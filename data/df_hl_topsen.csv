UW prides itself on being a flagship research university, but as a current undergraduate student, I do not feel that the university is fulfilling its mission to faithfully serve the state. One issue I feel strongly about is sustainability. UW speaks highly of its sustainability practices and mission, but the rosy picture they paint does not reflect reality. UW currently invests millions in the fossil fuel industry through its endowment funds and trusts. Fossil fuels do not promote a sustainable future for alumni and current students. Additionally, although the university has taken steps towards reducing carbon emissions, they still rely on fossil fuels for 90% of campus energy. When students voice the need for more proactive climate action, administrators often deflect or minimize the concerns.
