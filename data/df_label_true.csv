Most of the dorms are very nice and spacious! The dining hall is pretty good, not amazing but certain items are very tasty. Being from Los Angeles, the weather is a little bit of a downer but I am starting to get used to it. On the down side, the majority of students at the university are very conservative and not particularly open-minded...many Trump supporters not willing to hear out other peoples' sides! There is a lack of diversity! I am a Latina female and sometimes feel like I am being looked at differently by others, especially white males. The pro-life debate is a hot topic here, and is essentially expected of all of the traditional Catholics on campus.

I am maturing more as I go there, and I am learning more about my persona and who I want to become. My family has always been by my side; they are my ride or die; however, not having them or holding their hand and living in the dorms with another person who I never met has strengthened my independence. I have met many students from various diverse cultures; however, I was unsure at first because I am Latina and UCI has a huge Asian demographic. However, that thought was eliminated when I realized that I still have my culture surrounding me every day.

I had fun, gained a ton of experience, and put together a pretty solid portfolio! 

I took 15 Weinberg classes (mostly history and English), which were excellent. Professors were engaging and kind. I enjoyed every class but one, which says a lot; I'm very picky. I can't recommend Northwestern's humanities departments enough.

RTVF, however, was a waste of my time. You learn nothing in class that can't be learned far more efficiently on set. My professors were excellent, but classes were most useful as opportunities to network with other student filmmakers. You can't do film on the side, either. 99% of RTVF classes are for majors only. Aspiring filmmakers go somewhere cheaper, or just go straight to LA.",178,You learn nothing in class that can't be learned far more efficiently on set,academics,neutural

Socially, Haverford can be miserable if you aren't an athlete. I haven't found any people I gel with at all despite forcing myself to go to the pitiful ""parties"" that sports teams host. At least I can say I've tried. I also realize the liberal arts way of education isn't for me, so that's my mistake applying ED here. As a freshman, campus feels like a bubble and you see everyone you don't want to see every day. You know everything about everyone and vice versa. Not my kind of environment whatsoever. Academics have also been grueling without much payoff. I haven't internalized a lot of the content despite putting in so many hours outside of class. I can understand your enjoyment of Haverford if you're a STEM major, but don't apply if you're not. Everything outside of that department is lackluster.

I remember being a doe-eyed freshman walking into that building only to leave in tears after the front desk worker belittled me when I came to her looking for guidance. I changed my major after that; I couldn't bear the thought of having to deal with people like that for 4 years. It worked out in my favor though as I was welcomed with open arms at the English department. I wish all the staff shared that warmth that was shown to me in the English department.

We seem to think that we have room for about a thousand more people than we actually do, and that leads to people living in sub-par situations (3-4 people squeezed into a 2 person dorm, RA's with roommates, and office spaces that have been made into an 8 person dorm). 
Some good things are the academics. The professors are awesome and the versatility at the school is great. Studying anything is possible and you will end up with a good degree and will be taught by teachers who truly care.

bafd9559-8757-442a-b338-995f08edf30a,"I enjoy Purdue University, but I would not say that it is the greatest university in the world. There are many things that need to be worked on. One of the main areas is diversity around campus. Purdue is a PWI and it definitely shows in not only the objective student body race but also the close-mindedness that many, many, students share. 
Another problem is the housing crisis that this campus is facing.

f1e685fd-729d-487b-ba1f-04b051548acd,"Iv tried to start this review 5 times without sounding that negative but honestly I hated my time at GW and am extremely happy that I chose to transfer after one semester. GW is not a school but instead an corporation that cares very little for their students. The school is insanely expensive and provided with me a sub par education; while yes I was there for only one semester, I was rarely challenged or interested in my classes. disregarding one class, my classes were all 70-300 people and individualized attention was impossible. I should have expected this with a large school but the show the school puts on for interested students manipulated the reality of what class size would be like. Beyond academics and price, I never once felt at home at gw. The school has little to no school spirit and most of the time I felt like I was just living in a big city not a college campus. I never thought that community would be such a big part of being happy at a college but after going to GW where there absolutely no community, I realized it is essential. While I met a few wonderful people, on the whole the kids at GW are rich kids who only care about what opportunity they can seize next and do not care much about anyone but themselves. The school is primarily liberal so I was expecting to find like minded people to me but instead found some of the most close minded people I have ever met who care more about the idea of politics than the actual issues. The best way to describe them is people that recycle because everyone else is recycling, not because it's the right thing to do. In reality, this negative review is influenced by the fact that GW wasn't right for me. there are kids that love GW, but for me, the school lacked a reason for its price, a friendly welcoming community, people who genuinely care about each other, a administration that isn't shady and frustrating, and mainly, that feeling of home that so many kids feel when they're at college.",590,"The school is insanely expensive and provided with me a sub par education; while yes I was there for only one semester, I was rarely challenged or interested in my classes.",academics,negative
