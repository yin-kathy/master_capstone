There is nothing elite about Amherst other than the decaying brand name and its recognition, especially regarding the quality of services this place offers. The workload is unreasonable, and most classes move at a pace that forces kids into ADHD prescriptions not to fail, especially in STEM. If you plan to apply to law/med school/grad school, you won't have anything else in your life other than your studies. This place fails to promote healthy balance, and instead of making structural changes, overmedicates kids. The dining hall is humiliating, small, and serves subpar slop, and rich kids order food 24/7. The income and culture divide on campus is unbearable, and unless you are from the tri-state area/Cali and play a sport, don't expect to fit in.

Athletes have a dominant role on campus, making up 35% of the population despite being a DIII school. Rape, criminal damage and drug use are big ongoing issues propagated by student athletes. 

Academics are generally good, though workloads vary massively between majors. Classes are small, and professors thoughtful. 

Amherst is not a social place and COVID restrictions excessive for the Colleges size and location have really crippled the social scene further. Mental health is bad, with no clear path set out to improve this. You either form a clique or live alone here. The student body is racially diverse, but is among the wealthiest in the country, which shapes the culture.

Amherst gave $20k, which is only 25%, and not very generous, in my opinion, considering the cost of education here is $80k. Thus, my sister paid 25% to attend her college and I had to pay 75% to Amherst. Not only does Amherst cost more than other colleges, they are stingier with financial aid. That's been our experience.

47cbbf36-71c6-4e98-8943-80ee58fec6c8,"Amherst is a good school, but not without issues. Looking back, I wish I had listened to those around me and went somewhere else, but I bought the marketing ploy. I think that if I had come a few years earlier, or a decade from now, Amherst would have been/will be a much better place. Presently, the institution is experiencing a difficult transition. According to our annual student surveys, dissatisfaction with the social life is at an all-time high which I think is a consequence of students not being able to finds a place to 'belong.' The College has placed such emphasis in accepting everyone that no one feels like a part of an in-group, there's no unity/camaraderie. On the one-hand, we have athletic teams which seem to have a decent social life, and on the other, there are student activists blaming athletes for the dismal social scene. 

You may have heard that membership in a Greek organization, even off-campus/underground, is forbidden. I never intended to join a fraternity or sorority, but I think this new rule is not going to help matters. When everyone is invited to everything without any form of membership requirements, this creates a lack of commitment on the part of individuals, which, in turn, results in low turnout for events/clubs/gatherings. 

Moreover, the College's commitment to diversity seems to have caused a fragmentation of the student body, as groups seek to associate with people like themselves and vilify those who are not. I think diversity is a great thing, it's just that Amherst is currently going through some growing pains.

Say u grew up in MA or CT or any small suburban town in the North.  You've destroyed this small community and life and think... I'm ready for the real world. I have self-assurance, independence... who cares if UM and all the values it represents is everything I deeply dont resonate with. Ill adapt to any environment and make it my own when I find the right people. Wrong. If you enjoy life past a sneaker pool party, tanning next to a fully functioning pool,  and seeing a palm tree, seriously turn around.

I applied to this school early decision, convinced after the campus tour and research that it was the best choice. It really is just average. Academically, there are many required courses where it's hard to find a teacher that isn't poorly rated. It seems that the better professors are at the 300 and 400 level for junior and senior year, but many of the intro classes seem to have high turnover, and there is a disconnect between the university's standard for curriculum and the professor's content. Socially, the weekends are very quiet unless you are attending sporting events or greek like off campus. UM is one of the only schools that does not offer any merit scholarships.

Why would anyone pay for something that has been so greatly diminished? Would anyone pay full price for half of a f150? I think not.  The only reason VT can get away with it is because their main costumers are high school students that don't even understand the amount of debt their going into.

The overall vibe is very straight, and I often find myself feeling uncomfortable walking around campus, not because anyone has ever been rude or hostile to me, but because passing hundreds of people every day and seeing very few who are like you can be disheartening. Frat guys often vandalize the residence halls with homophobic messages.

All that being said, I never feel physically unsafe on campus - I am female and I walk around by myself at night often and I'm always fine.

The party scene is HUGE at tech and if that isn't your thing there are very few other things to do. Campus is in the middle of nowhere.

There are just gardens and ponds and even though is very nice to take walks there, it still feels boring. I understand some people don't find it boring because they attend all the crazy frat parties. But there are people who do not like parties and wish to have access to some enrichment of another kind. Furthermore, the amount of sexual assault cases that are being reported is concerning.

However, there are areas for improvement, such as large introductory classes, campus facilities, and social integration for transfer students.

This is an issue seen in many schools, but I really think calculus classes (as you get up to higher math courses this problem does not persist) should not be as difficult as they often are.

Of course those are important factors one should consider when applying to schools, however, that should not be the sole deciding factor.  In Villanova's case, the social scene is very poor.  This is in part due to Radnor, the surrounding community.  Radnor will try to do everything in its power to undermine Villanova.  This in turn takes away from student life and the social scene.  Because parties are not able to take place in walking distance, there are fewer parties and they are very exclusive to greek life or select clubs.  Students need an outlet to blow-off steam and parties are the typical remedy.  Villanova is not the place (at the moment) for students who seek a well-rounded college experience.

With one and a half quarter of online classes and four quarters of paying for expensive parking, the college reputes itself as a school that boasts its research funding but leeches off of its students pockets.

Parties wont be found unless you join a Fraternity or have established connections, and job opportunities are limited to career-fairs and handshake applications. Nestled in the heart of Orange County, the campus thrives within million dollar houses and a very large and beautiful park.

Almost the entire area is owned and run by an outfit called the Irvine Company, which regulates everything from the color of your house to the length of your grass. This affects campus culture. I've never been to a place with so little counter culture, and I grew up in upstate New York. If you're on the more liberal side or if you're a more offbeat character, or even if you just like being an individual, you might not have a great time at UCI. That said, it's a very safe town and the academics are very challenging, especially in the hard sciences, so it earned a slightly higher rating than I'm otherwise inclined to give it.

This shift affected the campus life immensely to the point where you couldn't have a dialogue, and saw a clear bias in the campus newspaper. Campus life, and the OC community is very cliquish, and nowhere near as diverse as they claim to be.

As a freshman you are required to pick from two meal plans, both $3,475. As a sophomore, you are also required to pick a meal plan. All of them are also $3,475. As a sophomore, you have 3 options, all $3,475, the best deal being TU7.

TU 7: --- $3,475
7 meal swipes
$1000 wave bucks
$50 nola bucks

TU 8 --- $1,295
8 meal swipes
Optional add on wave bucks or nola bucks

Juniors, who get to pick whether or not to get a meal plan, get to pick TU8. As you can see, TU8 is significantly cheaper and even if you chose to add on $1,000 Wavebucks and $50 nola bucks, it would be $2,345. 
My point is TU7 is $3,425, but if Sophomore's could get TU8, you could get a very similar plan for $2,345.

The only downside many students pertained to was the balance between school work and social life and the cost of attendance.

UW prides itself on being a flagship research university, but as a current undergraduate student, I do not feel that the university is fulfilling its mission to faithfully serve the state. One issue I feel strongly about is sustainability. UW speaks highly of its sustainability practices and mission, but the rosy picture they paint does not reflect reality. UW currently invests millions in the fossil fuel industry through its endowment funds and trusts. Fossil fuels do not promote a sustainable future for alumni and current students. Additionally, although the university has taken steps towards reducing carbon emissions, they still rely on fossil fuels for 90% of campus energy. When students voice the need for more proactive climate action, administrators often deflect or minimize the concerns. I cannot recommend UW until they take sustainability more seriously.",2,Sophomore,2021-11-08 03:27:25,Overall Experience,fed9be26-518d-4a71-ba22-cd4ad1066ffb,2021,University of Wisconsin,negative

It is very difficult and often very ostracizing living in this otherwise extremely nice building, as everyone tends to go out to fraternity parties and bars, whereas I am left here alone.  Many of the people are very difficult to be friends with and, while the school proclaims it is not very Greek, it certainly has an extreme emphasis on partying.

UW lacks diversity and while many say it's not, Greek Life is VERY much a big deal here...and its people essentially control the party scene. Many of the people here (mainly those involved in Greek Life) are pretentious and unfriendly, so beware of this because it definitely blindsided me as a friendly and approachable person.

Furthermore grades were based upon subjective views on your own writing, which could vary between TA and professor versus other students. many professors didn’t even take time to know or learn students names, making you feel like your presence in the classroom was unnecessary. Feeling like a number instead of an individual, or a talent, or an intellectual, hinders the ability to trust and believe in your academic ability. lastly many of the grading scales were extremely tough, with only the top 2% getting a 4.0. I would expect this from the school like Harvard law, but from an undergraduate program especially in humanities, this was honestly over the top.

The UW will leech money from its students to a far extent, and make its registration for classes competitive when its already flooded with weed-out classes. There is no reason there should be a 6:00 AM registration time where your heart is pounding and your blood is pumping, hoping you get the classes you chose so that you aren't stuck on campus until 9:00 PM at night to finish a lab, which is so dangerous for students.

Registration is a nightmare. There’s probably only one option for your class, so you can’t pick a preferred time/professor. Plus, with so many people, you probably won’t even get the class you want/need and you have to keep trying again every semester. Plus, they try as hard as they can to hold you back so you pay more money and graduate late.
Parking? Doesn’t really exist for students. Plus, for commuters, you have to park past the east side of campus. All of my classes are on the west side, so it’s about a forty minute walk every day.

To make matters worse, the rates are going up even higher and the University won't do anything about it. In fact, they bought up one of the local apartments and RAISED the prices.

He, of course, isn't from my major and only knows about my professors and courses from what other students tell them. Now the incoming freshmen can't get their courses either because UT admitted too many freshman and students who took the year off coming back at the same time as well as profs refusing to teach in person.

-The administration is alienating, and I have spent years being brushed off from one faculty to the next (*was in UTTD).
-The online UI is a catastrophic labyrinth-- getting a single thing done can take several days and emails. 
-The University's ethics are questionable. Peep their issues with faculty to student sexual harassments and deceptive ""green"" image in relation to fossil fuels.

They put a bunch of weed out classes in the intro sequence, and then when you finally get past 311 you are a senior. You can't take upper level CS electives until you have ALL of the intro sequence complete, meaning you end up being a senior and learning job skills 1-2 semesters before graduating.

Many people just can not keep up with the work demand from this school and drop out of the pre med track, it's very common. Additionally, UNC is a very liberal school, probably one of the most liberal in the south. The students are extremely liberal and are easily offended by republican beliefs.

93ab1e6f-a181-4145-bbdc-613ff19f2449,"Studying at UNC Chapel Hill is a great privilege, still with room for growth. This review is specific to my experience as a master's student in the School of Social Work (with in-person, hybrid, and virtual classes). My pro's & con's center on 2 topics: 

Quality mentorship: The primary reason I came to CH is because of the quality mentorship from faculty & staff. Compared to my previous experiences, this school offered the perfect combination of expertise in what I hoped to learn along with supportive mentors.

Definitely no, not at all. They have a “CAMPUS”, which is Washington Square Park, however, it really isn't. The park is mostly covered by tourists, workers, homeless, and violent people. It's not safe. Being at NYU will make you feel like a number. You will feel like an anonymous student studying in the middle of the city. What about the education quality? I think NYU offers a good education quality, however the price is still a little concerning, specifically for lower-middle class families. In terms of giving financial aid? yes, NYU are not generous.

This has led to students being housed in hotels, something that could've easily been avoided by both admitting less people along with buying/creating more housing buildings (also NOT shutting down a dorm for renovation the same year NYU admitted the most students).

The on-campus living experience is very low -- even among other colleges in downtown areas.
- The on-campus meal plan is mandatory and awful (think soggy, unseasoned microwavable food) and very expensive ($16-18/meal depending on the meal plan you select and how many meals/week it comes with). 
- Dorms are much more expensive than off-campus options. Before enrolling, I didn't realize how that would affect social life, but meeting people in dorms happens very little after the first year, since students elect to live in off-campus living ASAP. 

Joining a frat/sorority can be a saving grace of the social experience here, but joining lots of clubs doesn't quite match the social experience of other colleges.

Speaking of food, meal plan food is horrible. There are countless accounts of food having hairs, bugs, or mold. Eating here is a gamble, where you have a chance of resuming your day or spending hours on the toilet.
Berkeley in general has a major homeless problem. There are so many tents near and around the school, and the general area is unsafe at night. Every night, there is at least 1 burglary on a street near the school.

I think the academics are top-notch, the campus intimate and naturally stunning, good weather, the kids held emotionally and the staff pretty perceptive (extremely thoughtful application, not letting the students choose their roommates, having the students do a long sexual harassment online seminar and drinking quiz pre-entry).  I think WFU truly cares about your kid.  It is VERY Greek-heavy, not diverse at all, the contained campus can feel isolating, and sports matter.

Housing I think is our second biggest issue. Junior year if you don’t go abroad (or do), you’re screwed since you have to live on campus. Sophomore year also doesn’t have the best housing. I wish they would listen to us and change this. 

Food is pretty good I would say, academics are good (not too challenging, I’m a psych major but 100% depends on major), many ways to get involved, and overall gorgeous campus and great place to learn and have fun.

Spanish 3 & 4 could only be taken at certain times, so I had to spend extra to take classes I didn't want. The other kicker was that Spanish here is taught so poorly when compared to proper language-teaching techniques that I spent 4 semesters and thousands of dollars to barely remember anything I learned, while on my own time I've learned Thai almost fluently for a few hundred bucks & a lot less time. It's not necessarily the teacher's fault as they had a book & curriculum to follow (we had to purchase the course from a book publisher even though we paid for the tuition & course fees) but the techniques to learn were not conducive to most people's learning styles.

This often turns out well because many professors are intelligent and thoughtful, but often still I have classes with professors who don't seem to care much about their students and the grading scheme comes across as completely arbitrary.

As a black woman and a child of an immigrant, this program allows me to get the help I need in order to successfully graduate with a degree in biology. This biology program and Cornell in general also provide classes that will give me a lot of hands-on experience in the field as a researcher, which can help me prepare for my future career. This past spring break I was able to go to the Galapagos where I spent two weeks learning about biodiversity while visiting parts of the Galapagos islands. Recently, this summer I went to an island off of Maine to take a summer course on shark biodiversity and conservation and was able to conduct an experiment with baby catsharks.

However, I must also note the negative aspects. Although the University of Chicago preaches inclusion and diversity, they don't seem to do nearly enough. Overall, UofC feels like a privileged bubble. More than that, instead of trying to incorporate and help the South Side community, UofC continuously gentrifies and uses the excuse of 'student safety' to expand their control on the South.

The government department is very theory/political philosophy-focused.

a56734db-cbe9-4051-ba7c-3941f007449e,"I've had some great classes and experiences at CMC, and a few that weren't so great. Anyone coming to CMC should be aware that the social scene is pretty centered on alcohol and partying (though there is a substance free dorm with a strong culture, and a surprisingly high number of people who don't drink/go out). Thankfully, the parties are on campus, hosted by the student government, and open to everyone. There isn't a whole lot of the sketchiness or exclusivity that usually comes with frat parties at larger schools, since parties are open to everyone. I see this as a huge benefit of the school, though I no longer regularly attend parties.

It's really easy to get involved in things you're interested in, whether that's student government, a club, or research. Research opportunities are probably more available for Econ majors than others, and in the sciences/engineering you won't have the same kind of research experiences you would at a school that has real researchers.

We have some great professors here. Philosophy is by far the best, and there are some excellent professors in probably all of our other departments as well. In my opinion as someone majoring in both, our government and economics departments aren't deserving of the reputations they have. I wouldn't come here looking to study science, engineering, or pre-med, unless I'm also really interested in studying the humanities/social sciences. Classwork is generally reasonable, though challenging. People are motivated, but not super competitive with each other or stressed out, which is great.

Many CMC students are smart, motivated, and interested in their academic subjects. Others are more interested in partying. Many are a mix of both. People are not particularly artsy or creative; if you are, you might feel that side of yourself slipping away over your four years here (though we're getting better and now have a dedicated music space on campus).

Every professor I've had here is great and I've learned so much. This school is tough. Academically, socially, and mentally. It's so extremely hard to literally just survive here. First off, being in midtown Atlanta is the worst. Midtown is easily the most boring and one of the worst locations in Atlanta. Nothing is ever open. Everyone here studies till late hours and then literally just not eat because there's literally no decent food.  Except for cookout and McDonalds which is still a far walk from campus, and sometimes still not even open. But that's just one of the little things that ticks me off.

-Academically, Bowdoin is great. Profs are great (if a little quirky), but always make themselves available.

-Bowdoin is a VERY culturally homogeneous place. Bowdoin’s reputation as a happy campus stems from homogeneity: a vast majority of students are from the Midatlantic or Northeast, and went to private or boarding schools.

-Socially, Bowdoin takes on a boarding school culture. Acapella performances, plays, and ultimate frisbee teams are big on campus, and if you don’t love these, it’s hard. Many people act aloof, tense, and unfriendly, and the parties are pretty bad. Socially it’s pretty dead here.

Career center does not help very much with internships.  The college advertises on campus summer internships, but if you haven't declared a major, or havent taken enough classes in your major (see above), those aren't available.

Bowdoin is not that typical LAC in the middle of nowhere--Brunswick is the cutest town with tons of coffee shops and amazing restaurants; Freeport is a great place to do some shopping and spend the day with friends; Portland is an amazing, safe city. It is very easy to get to these places through a $3 bus. The health services are pretty terrible though; the counseling services are subpar at best, and if you are sick and don't have immediately diagnosable strep, the health center won't do anything for you.

For me, it was hard to make close friends at first.

My biggest disappointment was lack of support for the athletes. Unlike other D1 schools, Davidson athletes register through the same random assignment system as the non-athletes and have to take at least 4 units (16 credits), making it difficult to get courses needed to stay on track for degree plan while having a class schedule that allows flexibility around practice and tournaments. My kid struggled to balance the academic load with the demands of two a day practices and travel every other week during competition season. And the counselors, tutors, and related support staff that other D1 schools have? Nope, not Davidson.

Between student mental health, poor social life, and a strong lack of activities on campus, I would say that the only good thing about Davidson is the classes. Additionally, Davidson preaches community and open-mindedness, but this is all a facade for the toxic cancel culture that exists at Davidson. I witnessed time and time again a closed-minded ideology born out of the idea of intellectual superiority, as if you can only be a good person if you fall on the far left of the political spectrum.  While some professors strongly adhere to the idea that everybody has a right to their own opinions, others feed into the starkly opinionated student body.

The worst part of the overall experience is the value. You pay $60,000, but they won't give you textbooks. Or school supplies. Or even soap. The tuition is exorbitantly expensive.

The entire campus is walkable, which is very refreshing and means your friends, food, and classes are only a few minutes' walk away. With a smaller student population, students are able to have very close relationships with professors and are easily able to get academic and personal help. The obligatory Honor Code means that Davidson is very safe, with lots of trust built between students, faculty and staff--this means if you lose something, people will search out the owner, students are trusted to complete exams at home and if needed, professors are willing to be flexible to accommodate students' needs. Although Davidson is small, it is a close-knit, thriving community of sports, arts, humanities, sciences full of intelligent, thoughtful and honest individuals.

When I graduated from Williams in 2012, the community was much friendlier. Talking to some of the students baffled me, to say the least. I felt that they were extremely arrogant and downright disrespectful. Since my time there, Williams has changed immensely. Although it has only been six years since my graduation, it has completely changed for the worse. I was shocked to see that my peers were jobless and unsuccessful. It was clear that Williams did NOT prepare them for the real world.

Financials: I am a recent alumnus from a foreign country who had to pay less than 3K per year(!) towards my education at Williams; the rest was covered by non-repayable Williams grants. The College also pays for your medical insurance, ALL book expenditures, yearly round-trip to your home country (with all expenses). Other one-off expenses they covered: getting a visa, passport renewal, dental expenditures (over $10K). For someone who comes from a poor family whose total earnings are less than $30K/year, all this was an enormous benefit!

There is not enough being done for marginalized folks or survivors of sexual harassment and assault. Oftentimes, the university overlooks crimes that take place involving these individuals and aims to push them under the rug. In addition, services like CAPS and Sexual Health Education need more funding and to be expanded.

Palo Alto is definitely not a college town, though, and the expensive restaurants and old white men bars are not the most fun to go off campus. However, most people don't need to go off campus much, if at all. Everything you need is within the large campus, which is a big bubble, but a special one.

When speaking to friends who attend other colleges, I am repeatedly shocked by the lack of resources they have compared to MIT. Our S^3, DAS, and TSR^2 departments have saved my life so many times.
 It's so easy to make an appointment with mental health services, although they are overloaded.

Are most people here somewhat depressed? Yes, at least in my experience. 

There seems to be a great divide between the neurodivergent-LBGT-weird East side of campus and the more normal west side of campus, and I can only offer the East campus perspective (Random Hall). MIT does seem to be doing actions that suppress the east campus side, which is bad. 

But I don't think I would go anywhere else. The people here are very genuine, if stressed; the financial aid is great; Admissions and S^3 and some other departments really care about the kids; there is so much opportunity; and we're WAY better than harvard.",4,Freshman,2021-10-27 18:21:17,Overall Experience,,2021,,positive

I know some other majors like chemical engineering are more difficult and aren't quite as adored by their students. 

If you ask a student what there favorite part about MIT is, 90% of the time they will say the people. Being a specialized and somewhat quirky school, students at MIT have so much in common. Usually, that commonality is a passion to make a difference, openmindedness/acceptance, and a desire to play hard when not studying.

The curriculum is rigorous and challenging, which I appreciate as it pushes students to their intellectual limits. MIT's focus on combining theory with practical application is particularly engaging. For example, not only did I learn the theory behind machine learning algorithms, but I also got to implement these algorithms to solve real-world problems. This hands-on approach is what sets MIT apart from many other institutions.

Harvard costs what your family can afford. They make sure of that. If your family's income is less than $85,000, you'll pay nothing. For families who earn between $85,000 and $150,000, the expected contribution is between zero and ten percent of your annual income.

Harvard is more affordable than public universities for 90 percent of Americans—and international students receive the same financial aid as American students. Harvard makes sure that they have an affordable option for your education.

They follow two important principles:
1) Need-blind admissions. Your financial need and your aid application will never affect your chance of being admitted to Harvard.
2) 100% need-based aid. They base aid awards on need, not on merit. This means that financial aid supports the students who will benefit from it the most.

However, I find the social scene at Macalester to be extremely difficult to navigate. I have found so far that many students are unmotivated and have come to college for the ""typical college experience"" of partying and engaging in social activities instead of furthering their academic career. I have found this to be isolating and difficult to overcome. I came to college excited to learn and delve into my studies, and I've had a difficult to find friends who are as motivated and determined as I am. I would definitely recommend for every prospective first-year to visit the campus and spend the night with a first-year to receive a more intimate experience of the campus before committing to this school.

I learned an incredible amount from my peers about equity and justice, but beware of the self-agrandizing attitude that some students will take when they recognize that their social status is tied to their righteousness.

While Macalester does have a lot of representation from other countries, my time at Macalester has made me wonder what diversity does look like. I think it's great to have students from over 90 countries in the world, but sometimes, if there is only 1 student from many of those countries, it puts a lot of pressure on international students to ""perform"" their nationality and serve as a generic template for all people from that region.

d89db670-d517-4af2-8161-dbde0cccbfe3,"Babson College, known for its prestigious reputation and diverse range of experiences, lacks organized events and resources for students despite the high tuition fees and business school fame. It is important for Babson College to enhance its event offerings and allocate more resources, considering the substantial investment made by students. Furthermore, although the Trim dining hall food prices have increased recently, there has been no noticeable improvement in quality. It is crucial for the college to prioritize genuine student care over financial gains. Additionally, the career fair at Babson College fails to attract reputable companies, despite the school's esteemed status as a renowned business institution.

Classes heavily rely on group work, which has perks, but with the massive con that a lot of your education comes from your peers who are also fresh out of high school, instead of your professor with a PHD in their fields. A select handful of mandatory classes are genuinely challenging, and a good amount of classes are genuinely interesting. What can not be stressed enough though, is the dire state of the food. The dining hall is an afterthought for administration but a three meal a day occurrence for students. I've known people to become ill, find metals, and large patches of mold in their food. Staff can be rude, and administration largely refuses to listen. I would recommend Babson to a peer based on the environment and education without a doubt.

Here you will meet some of the most influential families around the world, and meet some of the richest people you'll ever meet. Also, some of the most successful entrepreneurs are going to be in your classes. Take advantage of the networking Babson offers, which in my opinion, is the best Asset of this college.

They were researchers,  not teachers. I went to the mental health counselor and it took over a month to get an appointment. The counselor was unhelpful as well. I told her I was concerned that I might have memory problems and she said, “remember this book title and read it on your own time”…The parking is absolute garbage.

They have straight-up performed the wrong task that we students request for, costing us time and most importantly opportunities for our success. The financial aid office has charged me over the amount I was supposed to pay, and I had to personally go meet with them for them to say ""oh yeah oops we'll fix that"". I could have accidentally paid too much for my tuition so many times if I did not check in with them every so often.

I'm graduating this year and our commencement is soon. Thousands of people will not receive their cap and gown on time. How does a school even do this?

We don't get access to the art studios, the libraries, and so many other resources on campus because of classes being online yet tuition is still higher this year. In addition to that, students still have to pay for activity fees, gym fees, sports recreation fees when there are no physical activities on campus, the gyms are closed, and sports don't allow spectators. Many students voice their opinions about these issues, but our voices always go unheard. As an art major, there aren't many options for alternate professors/classes in the art departments.

social life,

many struggle with social life here. students are not welcoming and friendly outside of the niche, most of them are nerds and not open-minded, not to mention, many only hang out with their own race/ethnicity, they are also stressed out.

There are no food options for vegetarians, & I found meat in the vegan station's tofu. The dining hall hours make no sense & there's no ingredient info available. Multiple people have had allergic reactions to food that staff claimed would be safe for them. The food is also just disgusting.

The admin is negligent at best & cruel at worst - they're completely out of touch w/ the student body.

At this point the only thing keeping W&M relevant is its academic reputation, but if you want a good overall college experience, look elsewhere. There are plenty of other options in VA (UVA, Tech, UofR, GMU) that are comparable in academics while harboring healthier and better environments for students' social, mental, and physical wellbeing.

Academics at the college are nothing to laugh about, and test the will and the abilities of the mind and body. However, classes are engaging, and are taught by some of the leading professors in their respective fields, making the workload significantly less stressful due to their diligent teaching methods and well-organized syllabi.

Staff/employees get irritated if you have valid questions to ask.  
You have to jump through hoops and go through other staff even to ask your professor a question or for help so basically your tuition is being invested for you to get feedback from TA's instead of the professor who only creates the audio, video aids, and notes.

It’s like nobody would notice if you weren’t there. The new dorms are horrible and made with cheap materials. All this school does is try to suck money from you for the most stupid reasons. The parking is the worst and nobody listens when the students say this over and over again. I will be transferring to SJU in Philly next semester and can not wait for a better college experience. Think twice before attending USF unless you want to be just another one of the thousands of students. Even the counseling department does a terrible job at responding to clients.

Most of my memories are being crammed in massive auditoriums and attempting not to fall asleep then having to run across campus to my next class across a barren hot landscape.

8 years after graduating I realize I don't keep in contact with anyone from my time there, my degree is completely unused and my best memories are formed post USF.

The school works very hard at flooding optimism your way- beware of orientation which makes you pay $84 per person for a week before registration. It is useless. In outside apartments, you have room to experiment with music, recreational activities like pool, frisbee, surfing, and friends because of their plethora of rules and regulations. What hurts the school is its lack of dedication to academia. The film department is very lacking in professors who actually care about incorporating method and practice. More, they obsess over appearances and reputation. If you don't have the name or the look they’re looking for you are taken major advantage of. The easiest way to tell if a professor cares is if they have 1 TA. If  they have more they are not grading your work and do not care.

I changed my major after that; I couldn't bear the thought of having to deal with people like that for 4 years. It worked out in my favor though as I was welcomed with open arms at the English department. I wish all the staff shared that warmth that was shown to me in the English department.

 I think this partly stems from the 'honor code', which makes it frowned upon to discuss grades and academic progress, and that carries over to professional development as well. The career office isn't that helpful either, so give up most hope of finding a good career post grad if you don't have those relationships in place by the time you graduate (or a strong gpa). The bright side is that most people go to grad school or continue their own educational path so Haverford is well respected in this way.

Academics have also been grueling without much payoff. I haven't internalized a lot of the content despite putting in so many hours outside of class.

Classes--some online--were challenging and (mostly) thought-provoking. The quality of professors varied but none were intolerable. I expect that is the case with introductory courses. Yet HC's small size means few students and plenty of opportunity for engagement. 
Dorm conditions vary but even the worst (Gummere) has only a few inconveniences that many residents claim to have become endeared to. 
Food isn't all that bad, despite what other reviews may say. Of course, it won't be your parent's cooking, but there is plenty of variety to keep your palate satisfied, even if the quality may lack. 
Student life has been quieter since people can't really meet in groups, but I've still found opportunities to get to know other students, and have been impressed by the candor and intelligence of people I meet.

The connections I made in my Customs group--a batch of 14 - 16 first-years with some upper-class mentors who engage in community-building activities throughout the year--eventually blossomed into lifetime friendships. 

I will say that the community's relationship with the honor code--that allows self-proctored examinations among other things--is more complex than is portrayed. There were murmurings throughout my time there that the number of violations far exceeded the number of reported cases.

d0c97cfb-dd8b-41e8-8dae-62abdf992d6b,Lehigh has a fairly good reputation and you’ll get a fine education but nothing you can’t find anywhere else. It claims to have a solid alumni network which is true of majors like finance or anything in engineering but not so much anything else. Location is suboptimal; not much to do in Bethlehem and definitely no career opportunities. Party scene was ok but will definitely suck with new Greek life rules. Greek community is extremely small and will continue to get smaller as admin kicks more organizations off the hill for no reason. If you’re not in Greek life it should be an interesting time for you getting into parties especially if you’re not a girl. Sports are meaningless here so if you’re looking to go to tailgates and whatnot we don’t do that.

The surrounding area is okay, I feel the Northside of Bethlehem is better but not at all a dangerous area, still pretty safe for the most part,  just be aware of your surroundings. I am also a minority too and I feel that the political and racial climate is fine, but there is still some microaggressions one can face but I never have felt  unsafe.

The fact that eating options only open at 11am on weekends further shows the schools desire to push students into a box.

After a year here, I have found it to be not only the antithesis of what I was looking for, I felt I have grown a lot more conservative since I first arrived on campus given the hostile attitude toward free speech and open dialogue.

632aafbc-6f9d-48dd-80b4-26badbbbf1db,"The first thing I want to say is DO NOT come to Vassar unless you and your family are significantly wealthy. The financial aid system is a joke. They treat you like a piece of paper, and are impossible to talk to. They claim to meet 100% of financial need, but that is almost never the case for students.  They are always looking for any way to justify giving you less financial aid.  If you don't think you can afford to go here, you are most definitely right. 

Now aside from all that, it is a good place to go to college. Surrounded by students who want to work hard and play hard. The amazing professors and resources that the school offers have set me up to be very successful after graduation. The people who work for in career development and grad-school advisement are very committed to their jobs! Vassar's prestige and connections definitely helped my get internships as well.

Intolerance for any views other than those of the extreme left is rampant and hateful. If you're a white male or anything right of extreme progressive, this is not the place for you. Most professors are extremely supportive, passionate, accommodating, and treat you like a PERSON instead of simply a student or a product. However, the teaching itself is often unimpressive and I have only felt truly challenged and inspired in a couple classes. Despite this, having nearly no core curriculum means the student can truly shape their own education.

As a scholarship student and an athlete who would have otherwise never had access to an institution like this without the campus' committee to need-blind aid, I never fit in.

Vassar claims to be a school that is very open to different perspectives and that strives to learn and understand other views, but this is only true when these views are progressive. In practice, students and professors at Vassar are quite single-minded, especially in the poli sci department, and don't explore or seek to understand/accept centrist, let alone conservative, points of view, which is detrimental to real-life application of learning. Sports aren't great at Vassar, but they are decent and there are opportunities to watch. Those who are looking for party life will find it, but it's not a super prominent thing for most students.

Vassar has a mostly open curriculum, though there are a few requirement such as a foreign language requirement. Admittedly, even though I understand why they have a foreign language requirement, I would prefer to put those units to something else. Still, Vassar doesn't have as many required classes as other colleges.

Some professors cannot be bothered to help their students learn. Classes between departments are never coordinated properly, classes inside departments are coordinated very poorly if at all. Prerequisite/Corequeiste means nothing. Taking a different section of the same class with a different professor might mean you get a completely different coverage of materials. Course sequencing is illogical. Campus does little to promote safety and there are violent crimes and shooting, and yet the only awareness programs to 'promote safety' concern sexual violence and not self defense or the like. Computer Engineering here is a complete joke, which is sad for a university that invented the discipline, and you are run through a gauntlet of completely disjointed elective classes that are supposed to build off of each other, but one class ends and another begins with a huge gap of information left between them, and the general response to this is ""oh, just learn that on your own"".

If you need to take chm at UCF just know it is very hard because almost every professor is terrible they don't put what they talk about on the exam it is hard to pass chm classes. The smaller classes are better because you will find the professors do care more! UCF is a really fun school, there are always events and I would say far more than any other florida school, you will not be bored here. The education here is good and it's a fun school so best of both worlds. I say its average just because some professors are really not worth the money I have left many classes learning nothing, especially if you have a hard major.

Missed out on a scholarship I was beyond eligible for, due to no one in admissions knowing the answer as to how I could apply even with it being listed as a honors society they accept.

The only people who seem to actually care about the academics are international students and profs (Greek life causes an avg. GPA drop of 0.75 according to Colgate itself).

The administration has been prioritizing a certain type of student, and value faculty and prospective students far more than the students already on campus.

One drawback I'd like to mention is that the student body isn't very diverse (which hasn't led to any negative experiences for me personally but I know it has for others).",4,Freshman,2019-12-23 23:35:39,Overall Experience,0055c0af-444e-46b0-a9a0-857a5e30966b,2019,Colgate University,positive

Colgates's 'core curriculum' assures every Colgate grad an education in essential subjects pretty much across the board, not just a bunch of courses which seems common in many schools. To graduate, you must have a good, broad education. 

Colgate's size means small discussion classes much of the time, and you have opportunities to actually talk to your teachers unlike in large lecture class at many more famous colleges. Be sure to ask about this.  It's a better way to learn and certainly more personal. 

Colgate's campus is as pretty as a postcard, the classic college campus on  a hill.

Trinity has extreme grade deflation as you continue into upper-level STEM courses, with a high withdrawal rate from STEM majors.

Trinity also combines General Chemistry 1 and 2 into one semester, so it is very challenging and graduate schools outside of Texas will make you take a General Chemistry 2 course (claiming you are missing a credit).

Of the three biology courses I took, the class average ranged between 52-56%. Extremely frustrating, also with a very low transfer credit capability. I scored a 31 on my ACT and was top of my high school, so I know how to work hard. However, Trinity made success on a pre-med track near impossible.

a2c88575-db7b-4063-aa74-77bc73e3d63d,"I attended Trinity briefly in the fall semester of 2021. I transferred schools after that first semester. I should have paid more attention to the reviews I saw. One stuck out to me from 2019 and they described the environment as a ""private public high school."" This couldn't be more true! The student body seems to lean very Texan, and very privileged. The food was okay, but did remind me of high school cafeteria food more often than not. 

Where Trinity excelled was the staff. The professors I had during my one semester there were wonderful. Very kind, thoughtful, and interesting. Their work was hard but felt rewarding. I adjusted well to the academic style of Trinity. If you're self-motivated, Trinity is a good fit for you. 

Here's a bullet list of pros and cons
Pros:
- wonderful staff and academics
- beautiful campus
- good access to downtown San Antonio
- nice dorms
Cons:
- privileged, sheltered, cliquey student body
- high-school-cafeteria-quality food
- cost

Also seriously consider the 3 year living requirement. It doesn't seem that bad at first but after your first year you are ready for a real place to call home. My dorm my sophomore year was infested with rats and it took a very long time to fix this problem. The food gets old after just a few months and is very over priced. Additionally, as you become a more mature adult having a roommate gets really old. Even if you really like your roommates like I did it comes to a point where you just want your own personal space.

For the cost of the school, I felt like the professors were not as invested in their students as Trinity claims they are. Several of my professors were extremely lazy, but I had no choice of having different professors because Trinity makes it impossible to take the classes you truly want/need to take. There is absolutely no school spirit or support for any of the sports programs which is a shame considering the success of the majority of the athletics.

Resources are endless and always opening through academics as well as extracurriculars, and the staff are nothing but helpful; it is certainly interesting to be surrounded by people who actually care about my success. Trinity is beginning to make a name on the map of Texas and the US, only widening experiences for the students and alumnus who made its name. The reason I only rated Trinity a 4 star is because I believe the school can only improve with the generations that grace the halls.

It is a small community, everyone knows everyone like high school due to the small size. Greek life is a great way to get involved but it isn’t a necessity.

The size can sometimes be isolating. But if you put in effort you can make friends and find a place to belong.

The people are fairly decent (not really weird), and the academics are fairly rigorous, ESPECIALLY IN STEM. The teachers are always willing to help and it is easy to form relationships with teachers as most classes only average around 30-35 students. Use office hours!!!

The food sucks, and some of the dorms need renovating. The three year residency requirement is something to keep in mind, it limits your freedom, a lot. It’s horrible.

I'm not a big party person but there are parties and also a really popular pub nearby that many students go to. Students here are very studious, so there's a strong work hard play hard culture. I feel super safe on campus. The dorms are really nice and most have balconies! I transferred here from ASU Barrett Honors and am really glad I did. The small class sizes are great.

Another problem is the housing crisis that this campus is facing. We seem to think that we have room for about a thousand more people than we actually do, and that leads to people living in sub-par situations (3-4 people squeezed into a 2 person dorm, RA's with roommates, and office spaces that have been made into an 8 person dorm).

However, the studies are rigorous here if one has any STEM major. Therefore, one needs to put in work which is great because you learn a lot in the process.

The Honors Engineering curriculum was very challenging to adjust to in comparison to my already rigorous high-school curriculum (i.e. largely independent work, very challenging coding programs, high-time pressure assignments, and general difficulty of concepts). So for STEM majors Purdue definitely challenges your ability to work effectively and manage time.
Yet there are so many resources for students throughout Purdue's massive campus. There are Math and Chemistry Resource Rooms, free tutoring by student organizations, academic consultations offered by the Academic Success Center, and well-designed study spaces like the Hicks Library, WALC, and more.

1): the average student at Colby is white, rich, and 20 mins N/W/S of Boston… if you’re not one, you’ll have trouble fitting in 2): social life: ~40% of students are recruited athletes and they are very closed off from regular students… you will have a much better experience if you are a recruit 3): the location: Colby is the most isolated liberal arts college there is and Maine during the winter time is a different animal… unless you love east coast skiing, you won’t find yourself going outside which easily leads to seasonal depression 4): the food is horrendous 5): housing sucks: Colby has a monopoly on housing, meaning that you will be penned in a dorm or, unless you do community service, you live in their off-campus apartments.

Classes are top-notch, though, especially ES. Endless funding and research to go around. 

But the homogenous social life and lack of inclusivity made the transition and the experience so hard. I found so many students to be shallow, immature, and cliquey. It can feel like high school---not welcoming, or warm and fuzzy. 

However, I do think everyone can find their ""people"" at Colby if they stick it out.  It may take longer than expected and you should always be yourself.

Its campus is very small; I've been able to walk from one side of campus to the other in only about 15 minutes. The campus's small size allows for students to meet with each other very frequently, allowing for interactions you won't get anywhere else. The campus is also very beautiful, and students are able to access natural bodies of water and landscapes easily. The academics and resources are top notch, with (usually) small class sizes, an undergraduate focus, and a large alumni network. However, there are a few possibly negative things to note before choosing Dartmouth. The weather is very spontaneous and can get down to the negative degrees Fahrenheit in the winter.

We didn’t have to supply our answers to each specific question but were asked for total scores at the end.

There was this one tradition where students would wrap this tall tower - one of the residential colleges was in a tower - in toilet paper, which was supposed to be funny apparently because the tower looked like a condom.

Additionally, Rice’s low student-to-teacher ratio, proximity to the Texas medical center, and clubs for students in pre-medicine create a space for me to interact with students with similar aspirations and provide a solid foundation for my future career in medicine.",5,Niche User,2022-11-01 23:14:49,Overall Experience,5747590f-e816-466d-a519-33f175061453,2022,Rice University,negative

The bio department only has a handful of classes with labs, which are a required component of med school applications and force students to take classes they're not interested in. The chemistry department only offers 3 of the 4 major required chemistry classes once per year, so if you don't come in with AP credit, you're forced to either take a gap year or study for the MCAT while taking biochem. Premed advising sucks (though I'm not sure how this is changing since the old advisor left), and they delayed most students' committee letters by WEEKS during my application cycle- which, since everything is rolling, is incredibly harmful to applicants' success. The school bends over backwards to arrange shadowing for PLMEs while they're in undergrad, but doesn't offer basic assistance to regular undergraduate premeds (who arguably need it more, since almost all med schools require shadowing to get in).

My only complaints would be the lack of communication from the offices of financial aid and residential life. Information is delivered late and confusingly.",5,Sophomore,2022-06-15 17:21:19,Overall Experience,f81ccefb-aaf6-4ceb-be7a-7797d1698e57,2022,Brown University,negative

I understand and fully support the college's faculty to have these opinions, though I feel it was extremely inappropriate to express these views in lieu of teaching.

One thing I will say, Harvey Mudd is very difficult. I assume you already know this if you are looking into it, but I want to stress that you will most definitely be challenged. There are many classes to get through, and they are very rigorous. There were a lot sleepless nights, several of which spent in the engineering basement. The constant flow of problem sets, quizzes, midterms and projects will keep you busy to say the least!

That being said, there is a wonderful support system at Mudd. Being in graduate school now, I really miss the accessibility to professors and student tutors.

Mudders are quirky as to be expected from STEM kids; hard workers who also know how to work hard. It is a wonderful place to grow as a student and person.

As with all schools, the most problematic part of Mudd would be the administration, especially in times of covid. The administration has been far too idealistic which means that they have been withholding information from us such as if classes would be held online or if housing would be open in the hopes that things would get better.

All they did was send me to the UCC for testing, but never actually addressed my struggles on the academic side. I sent emails, letters etc., but no one on the academic side really cared to help me. It became clear to me once I graduated - Vanderbilt responds to academic struggle with the question of “what is wrong with you?” instead of “how can we help you?”.

The academics are great but demanding. Your GPA could be low if you are not careful. The professors are responsible and approachable. Well, the quality of education is pretty good.

They are all very accomplished and esteemed; almost all of my professors this year were PhD's, but not all are the best teachers.  Most of the freshman STEM courses are weed-out, which is frustrating because with such a low acceptance rate, you'd think we were already ""weeded out."" The freshman math and science classes, and specifically exams, are unnecessarily difficult and clearly meant to get students to drop.  The discrepancies between different professors are huge.  If you are lucky enough to get a certain professor, you will actually be taught the course well and be prepared for the test.  If you get a different one, you may not be taught or even warned of all the material covered on the test.  My chemistry class was huge about 150 students even after several had dropped out.  I had to primarily rely on reading the textbook and my own outside work to actually learn the material and use going to class just as a supplement instead of the other way around.  Professors can be pretty helpful in office hours, but you need to go with specific questions already prepared.  Also be prepared for the occasional egotistic professor who will scoff at your questions and be rude. Engineering majors: the advisers are not helpful at all and will often tell you what is financially advantageous for the school.  They encourage first years to retake calculus instead of using AP credit in order to ""build a strong foundation,"" but any of the students will tell you this is an awful idea.  It is just a weed out course where nothing new or crucial is learned, it's just again unnecessarily difficult because the tests were very long and hard.

The professors are genuine experts in their fields, have published in scholarly journals, and are generally available for office hours. Small class sizes make for good class discussions and easy participation opportunities. Nashville itself is a great and fun city, and one that you can totally fall in love with during your 4 years at Vanderbilt. The campus itself is beautiful, with excellent academic facilities, guest speakers and food.

However, Vanderbilt is a study in constrasts. It is billed as a southern school, yet the majority of students are not from the south; a significant portion of them (the Northeasterners in particular) detest and despise the south as backwards and racist. They openly discuss how they wish they had gone to an Ivy League school, but were rejected and ended up at Vanderbilt instead.

Vanderbilt has a very clear class divide: the rich, white students join greek life and mostly stick to themselves, while the others, including minorities, hipsters, transfer students, the ultra-religious and those who just don't fit in to Vandy culture, are left to do their own thing, but are generally looked down upon as second class (socially speaking). Vanderbilt boasts that half the students receive financial aid, yet the diversity is sorely lacking; the clear reason being that the school is unwilling to take on and dismantle greek life for fear of losing alumni donations.

Most pathetically, Vanderbilt is located in a truly awesome city. And yet many students never leave the campus to see and experience Nashville, because many of them consider the south to be scary, backwards, racist, etc. And of course these people grew up in places like Scarsdale, Orange County, Chevy Chase, Highland Park, etc.",2,Alum,2016-02-20 12:59:39,Overall Experience,8a41db38-a2bb-4999-991b-cb37387781d7,2016,Vanderbilt University,negative

The black community here is really tight-knit, and the LGBT community is, too, but if you don't really fit into them, then you're on your own. I can't speak for the other minority groups. As a black kid in the middle-class, I can see this a lot, and it was initially really difficult for me to make friends because of that. The Chancellor of the school is working really hard to change that negative experience for minority students, but the community members as a whole (as in many of the students, parents, etc.) seem a bit resistant to it.

2.) The dinning here at Vandy is better than most. I've heard dinning best during the first year since the Commons dinning hall is so close to the first year dorms. Decent food is difficult to find during breaks and towards the end of finals season. I suggest taking advantage of the Meal Money and the Taste of Nashville restaurants. 

3.) If you ever get bored, then there is normally some kind of show going on somewhere on campus. Alternatively, you could gather some friends to watch a movie in one of the seminar rooms.

4.) Most of the people here are laid back and don't have a superiority complex. Impostor Syndrome is discussed every now and then though.

The school's location in Nashville also offers a wide breadth and depth of opportunities for students, ranging from exploring great food to becoming involved in impactful community outreach. Additionally, Vanderbilt is very much characterized by a collaborative spirit rather than a competitive one, as students enjoy studying together and helping one another find success.

Northwestern was a mixed bag academically. Some classes were great, but many were not. You will encounter lots of “dud” classes. The professors weren’t friendly.

Forty percent of the campus is Greek, and you will find that they treat those outside the Greek community with contempt. The student body didn’t show much intellectual passion. They didn’t care about what they were studying because they planned to go to law or med school.

I took 15 Weinberg classes (mostly history and English), which were excellent. Professors were engaging and kind. I enjoyed every class but one, which says a lot; I'm very picky. I can't recommend Northwestern's humanities departments enough.

RTVF, however, was a waste of my time. You learn nothing in class that can't be learned far more efficiently on set.

NU can be stubborn, however. There are many complaints about the usage of campus funds that need get resolved. The quality of dining halls has diminished with most of them closing at 8 pm (I’ve had classes that run until 9). There were recently strikes about the poor pay for dining hall workers, so while they claim the shorter hours and fewer options are due to short staffing, increasing pay would probably solve that. They can definitely afford it as they received the single biggest endowment in their history only last year. Many of the old dorms are severely lacking in amenities and have facilities that haven’t been updated. The quality of the dorms is extremely variable and honestly inequitable. Only being able to afford the cheapest dorms and losing sleep because of a lack of AC or and withering facilities can impact grades.",4,Sophomore,2023-02-23 06:26:00,Overall Experience,8ccaa673-b878-4654-a1cb-d11c55174936,2023,Northwestern University,positive

The college has great connections for post-grad opportunities in multiple fields - business, medicine, research, engineering. I was easily able to switch between the Arts & Sciences program and the Business School at the end of my sophomore year. There is a huge focus on medicine, so even for other career paths there are healthcare adjacent offerings (e.g. Healthcare Management, Bio Medical Engineering, Global Health, Psychology/Neuroscience/Philosophy). The brand name and resources do carry for other non-health related professions too. The classwork can be tough so it's best you find out which paths are a good fit for you in terms of academic rigor, class size, and teaching style. Your counselors can help with this.

As a pre-med, WashU's resources also helped me prepare a very competitive profile when I applied to MD-PhD programs owing to the research, shadowing, and volunteering opportunities both on the Danforth Campus and WUSM.

Student life is not super high-energy, but still active. Most students I acquainted myself with were approachable and highly talented.

The area around WashU and the medical school is affluent and there were few safety concerns when I attended.

We managed to get a key to the old astronomy building where a solar telescope was removed leaving a many storied hole in the building.  We managed to rig a pendulum to measure the latitude.  It was fascinating.  We were measuring the precession but got an interesting effect.  The pendulum which started as a line drag  showed that it was an eclipse with an increasing minor axis. Not a perfect result but one which required learning a lot.

If the administration really cared about stopping the spread of covid, on campus, as much as they say they are concerned, they would at least put in the bare minimum and clean these common areas daily (should be several times a day, but at this point daily would be a miracle).

This is one of the aspects that I really love about UCLA because as a first year, I was really homesick and as a quite introverted person, I stayed away from interactions. However, as I slowly involved myself and am still doing, I have grown to become more social and involve myself in the UCLA community.

You get real world experiences through professors who draw upon a lot of their industry experience, and not just academics lecturing you on theoretical subjects. There are also a lot of hands on opportunities through coursework and extracurricular activities on campus.

Fortunately, a new gym is currently being built to be open by 2024. Additionally, an incredibly difficult thing to change at the school also has to do with the academics, rather the culture of the academics at CMU. The issue with going to a widely-known intellectual school is dealing with the culture of people who constantly stress about lacking intelligence among their peers or the people who carry a hubris with them in and out of class.

Faculty are often times unhelpful and lax distracted by whatever else holds their passion more than their job. I think thats fine but the school has a tendency to hold on to these faculty and dismiss the faculty that challenges the mediocrity that is encouraged in the school environment. It's taken all that's in me to even want to continue and just finish out my education. The only thing keeping me going is that it will end soon.

The campus is also the most unfriendly environment I have been a part of. You could meet somebody at a party, but they won't say ""Hi"" back to you if you see them on campus a few days later. There is no uniting front that brings in a community. Clubs are the only way to make friends, but the ones where you'd actually make friends are super competitive so you find yourself very isolated.

My major was through the partnership with Columbia University, and there was a marked difference between the Barnard classes and those of Columbia.

I felt like I was being taught by professors who wanted to teach, rather than individuals who were just there for research.

The school is over 70,000 per year and everyone I know did not receive enough aid. Many students had to take out massive loans, work crazy hours, or put their family into debt/ poverty to pay for an education that is supposed to empower women, when it actually hurt a lot of them financially.

The Columbia Daily Spectator calls it “the only women’s college in the Ivy League.” Lots of recruited athletes at Columbia can go to Barnard instead of CC (Columbia College). A lot of friends were recruited CU athletes at Barnard. It’s also different from other women’s colleges because it feels like a women’s dorm at Columbia. It’s sooo integrated and feels co-Ed! The leaders of most Columbia clubs are Barnard women tbh. It can be annoying to constantly explain to people that Barnard is 100% integrated with the other schools at CU though.

The internships at Barnard are INSANE. I was a history major and got internships at top investment banks, big tech companies, famous TV shows and more.

There should always be a good balance in whatever school you go to both academically and socially. The career center is very unhelpful and doesn’t know anymore than a student who does basic research for internships. At the core of my negative experience is how the Administration handles issues.

I also really liked my freshman dorm room, as it was in a newly renovated dorm hall with a suite kitchen and bathroom. Going grocery shopping is also very convenient, as Whole Foods and Roche Bros are in walking distance from campus. Academic wise, most of my professors genuinely cared deeply for teaching and the subjects they taught. They were approachable and understanding, and as our class size is small (usually 12-25 students), it's really easy to ask questions in class and get feedback from your professors and peers. I also like the club experience, as well as how convenient it is to go into Boston using the (free on weekdays) shuttle system we have. Cons to attending include that it's a bit isolated, as we're a small school in the suburbs, and that the political culture is very one minded.

It's a lovely campus with beautiful older buildings, small classes, and friendly students. Although the social life may be limited, I enjoy the smaller campus personally gives more of a sense of community. But I will say the dining hall food requires attention, the food served is often repetitive and gets bland quickly. Though I believe it might be because of limited resources, but that should not leave to being served chicken nuggets and fries three to four times a week. The faculty are nice and for the most part approachable, and willing to help out! There is opportunities to get involved, either through organizations or work-study.

We also have good dining hall food (my personal favorite dining hall out of our four is Bates Hall).

Like many other students, I struggled a bit with the transition between high school and college, especially coming from a far away state where I was more than 4,000 miles from home. However, Wellesley's campus culture is friendly, so much so that it was easy to find friends once I began searching for them. One negative about campus culture however, is that it is synonomous. What I mean by this is that Wellesley's students are often on the same end of the political spectrum, which isn't bad, but it pushes for a ""radical"" political agenda where if one speaks unorthodox beliefs, then that person is committing social suicide. More often than not, I have seen students struggle to speak up about their own beliefs for fear of being exiled and unfriended.",5,Sophomore,2023-06-22 13:22:21,Overall Experience,f3f43192-6c4b-4c7e-91fb-865163711c5c,2023,Wellesley College,negative

3) The BU Hub system is terrible as it essentially forces you to spend years taking a combination of random classes with no freedom of choice and no relevance to your interests.
4) You will pass out on Boston internships to Harvard, MIT, Yale, and Williams students no matter how well you perform academically.
5) Support for international students is minimal.

If you're a girl, you can get into most any party, but will have slim pickings and will soon get bored of those guys because guys literally aren't allowed into parties. Guys who aren't on sports teams or in one of the three respectable frats on campus are simply screwed. Furthermore, there is no school spirit at BU. The hockey team is the only thing we have going for us, but really, who likes hockey? There are no tailgates, no popular events, and BU's almost non-existent Greek life will surely be extinct in a few years because the administration has sold their on-campus housing, cracked down on them, and made it clear they are not welcome on campus. Because of the linear and extremely urban ""campus""of BU, the anti-social kids in East campus rarely associate and mix with the better looking, more athletic, partier types in West campus. The administration is impenetrable and cares more about its image than transparency and justice with regards to discipline and sexual harassment cases. I myself am transferring next semester, and at least half the kids I've talked to about transferring say there are only one or two characteristics about the school that account for the reasons why they are still here, whether it be money or their friends. The academics of BU are really the only positive, if you can look past rampant grade deflation and the total absence of any atmosphere that inspires one to study.

While the professors are from prestigious background, I found that the grading system (grade deflation) at Questrom especially, doesn’t accurately reflect the efforts student put into the courses. If you do a research on schools that are hardest to earn ‘A’, BU is always on the lists if not the number 1 spot. Being a big school in general, from my experience, it was quite hard to get help from administration and services. I personally did not enjoy my social life there but i also wished that I could done things differently. I love the amenities on campus and the dining hall caters to dietary restrictions and religious practices (kosher and halal).",3,Alum,2022-04-30 04:29:26,Overall Experience,50ab8efa-6fa1-415e-bcf8-566999e9e5f5,2022,Boston University,neutural

She is in the business school when I called to speak about this I was told the major is so large that they have to do online.  Really? How about making it more selective? I feel like they have ruined her whole college experience.  My other daughter graduated from FSU and in four years she had maybe 2 online classes.  The poverty level in Gainesville is one of the highest in the nation and if you check the pedophile map in the surrounding area it would make you sick to your stomach.

Consequently, you should not entertain wishful thinking that the so-called rank of the College truly reflects that to which it is entitled. Much of the humanities are in nowise focused upon anything after which their courses are named; but, to the contrary, in the Intro to Linguistics class, for example, you learn nothing but critiques of traditional English grammar—the reasons for which traditional grammars are so constructed that they ridicule are not even being fully examined.

Faculty here are hit or miss when it comes to whether or not they are knowledgeable about the subject matter and7or the wellbeing of the students. That said, if you are from the state of Florida, in-state tuition is quite affordable. However the value stops with in-state students. UF is really just a sports school with a partying problem.

Signing up for classes was a breeze, and I had a great experience with the process. The university made it straightforward, allowing me to secure the courses I needed without any major issues.

However, the only downside I faced was during the housing selection process. There were multiple issues with the website crashing, which made it challenging for me to get the housing I had hoped for. Unfortunately, I couldn't secure the housing I wanted due to these technical problems.

Jocks are well liked and nerds that study ""too much"" are seen as irrelevant. Overall, while professors have inspired me, my high school prepared me for the real world much more than Bates.",3,Senior,2022-07-19 03:25:24,Overall Experience,2c036559-5ebb-4c00-b3b8-6679a91fb040,2022,Bates College,neutural

Overall I've really loved my time at Bates, although as a major in a smaller department (neuroscience) I've felt that students can be impacted negatively by deficits in resources.

Everyone wants to help you but they are unable to because it is not in their wheelhouse and they don't know whose wheelhouse your issue belongs in. As for being pretentious- lets talk about stress olympics; students constantly brag about how much homework and studying they must do and it quickly becomes a competition. The only greater compitition is who can drink the most liquor, and most students are competing in both of those areas. If you think living in a sub-free dorm will keep you sober. It won't.

Also, cancel culture is very, very, very real here: I’ve seen good, progressive people  get shunned just for asking the wrong question in a sociology class.

The urban location, the cultural blend, and the mass amounts of opportunities for adventure is amazing. However, as a Black individual, I have found assimilation into this PWI extremely difficult. Many others have experienced a similiar truth. The actual campus has quite divided ethnic groups, that have clubs that strictly stick together and do not collaborate. Microagressions are pervasive, not only amoung peers but amoung instructors as well. Additionally, factors like hazing, sexual assault, and mental health have consistently been pervasive problems amoung the student body. If the university would thoroughly address such problems instead of gliding over them or blatantly ignoring them, then perhaps my review would be higher.

I feel that all the professors I have had at Pitt are dedicated to helping each student achieve their goals and success. They are so committed to teaching students how to grow and thrive in several different environments.

I also think that Pitt has a unique social environment. There is enough space for everyone to create their own safe space at school and find the people they connect with. Everyone simply fits. 

 Pitt has so much energy and school spirit. Attending the football games and singing Pitts version of Sweet Caroline fills me with so much happiness.

I learned this the hard way after taking some really hard classes with bad professors and then reading reviews after the class was finished. There are a lot of research and prestigious research opportunity. The professors are all highly educated and will definitely prepare you for whatever field you enter. They are there to answer your questions! Though it is hard academically, it is full of friendly faces. I have attended a few different universities but BYU has stood out in spirit.

However, many of the experiences that I remember most tend to be negative.

Aside from these comments, I've also had extensive conversations with friends with disabilities that have had professors that were incredibly unaccommodating especially in emergency situations which needs to change as well.

The culture shock that happened for me as a person of color coming from an extensively diverse area has made it so difficult to feel apart of the community and to find and make a home for myself on campus and I don't know how to remedy that.

If your undergraduate program also offers a master's program, then nearly all of your classes will be taught by graduate students instead of professors, which honestly just leads to a lower quality education.

ce1a451d-4cf0-4c3a-8970-69c2f86a7e28,Hello my name is Elizabeth Alfred a current student athlete at FIU. FIU is a very unique diverse school. Moving from palm beach to Miami was a whole different change of comfort zone. Miami has made me a better person and so has FIU. As a student athlete I major in Criminal Justice. The criminal justice department are the most charismatic people ever. Willing to help out even outside of class which is very important for student just like me. I have it a 3/5 due to the way they treat their track and field athletes. Nobody but our coaches care about the track and field program. We don’t even have a track which makes it very difficult for athletes to want to attend FIU. FIU is a very beautiful campus MMC and BBC campus in north Miami. As much as I hate to say this but FIU student athletes deserve more. Not only track but even students we deserve better. It starts with one person and I pray that along the years. FIU can become a 5/5 for most students.,3,Junior,2022-12-07 05:13:07,Overall Experience,fa40c81d-f56b-4353-9518-17bb497b877f,2022,Florida International University,neutural

It is a pretty close school to where I live so I dont have to drive hours to get to and from the school from my home, plus many of my friends go there so that helps with the environment.

It can be stressful to juggle being a full time student while being a full time retail worker.

Students arrive very well-prepared, of course, to do rigorous academic work but they also all have a sense of where they want to go. It was not a place that pandered to students and I am so grateful that we were taught from the start that we needed to show up prepared with reading notes and questions. (I've taught too many students who think it is acceptable to roll into class with some half-baked ideas from skimming the reading; at Smith that was not tolerated). 
Of course, Smith housing is legendary, the campus is beautiful, and the 5 Colleges offer so many social opportunities!",5,Alum,2023-09-07 13:48:10,Overall Experience,10591a8d-619b-4c83-8026-cf6efcd12d36,2023,Smith College,negative

I have had access to academic and research opportunities equal to my friends at Ivy League institutions, but with the additional benefits of a small student to faculty ratio (more accessible 1 on 1 mentorship). It feels so inspiring to attend an HWC where thousands of powerful, historical women have been educated before me. Smith is a motivated and focused environment for people who love to learn. I enjoy the social scene because it caters to my preferences; I recognize almost everyone on campus, but still get to know new people every day. There are parties (lessened by COVID) but UMASS and the other colleges are easily accessed by bus. Northampton is an amazing town with a cozy northeastern feel. Get ready for some AMAZING (but expensive) coffee shops. The housing system is so unique and offers a sorority-like feel to those who choose to engage (also easy to opt out).

I do not recommend this school at all if you’re a minority. The campus is dominated by privileged white students who are ignorant to see the world and haven’t seen life much out of their upper middle class suburb. This also becomes frustrating because administration doesn’t protect minorities as they should. Administration is notorious for not providing campus with proper access and rights to LGBT students, students of color, and lower class students.

However, the science and engineering buildings are old and lab equipment hasn't been updated since the 80's. Clemson's focus has shifted from being an engineering school to a business school. That's fine, but as an engineering student it's frustrating to see other majors have updated, functional classrooms and equipment, while our equipment doesn't work half the time. 
The professors are pretty good. Some aren't great at teaching of course (especially the chemistry department) but they all care about their students. 
The student life experience really went down during Covid and it still hasn't returned to its former standards. The atmosphere on campus just isn't as vibrant. There aren't as many things to do.

If you aren't into the party scene or love spending 2 hours in traffic to travel 2 miles on football weekends, you want to live at least 20 miles away. The cost of living in the area will break the bank.

You can go to another school, take the exact same class, do half the busywork, pay A LOT less tuition, and still get a valid college degree. Faculty members are often demening and although they are usually friendly and work hard to make the experience good, they expect you to respect them at all times, even when they make stupid mistakes regarding things such as academic advising (academic advising problems arise a lot more than they should for a school this small), student housing issues, and unfair grades.

Housing is dusgusting, water in at least one dorm is always cold.  If you want descent housing you have to apply for a special program and take an extra class.  It costs the same as all the other housing.

Students are cliquy and drink way too much.  Greek life and sports rule the school.  If you don't participate in one or both of these, it's difficult to get acknowledgment from peers and staff members.

There is no diversity. Most of the students are upper-middle-class 18-22 year olds.

If you are a working-class student it's impossible to juggle the workload and a job.

No flexibility in scheduling.  You get what you get and often times it isn't what you need/want to graduate, or your classes are spread out throughout the entire day so you have no time for a job or extra-curricular activities.  There are also a rediculous number of adminsitrative hurdles to jump over just to even get signed up for a lot of the classes.

Not enough parking (and they are demolishing lots as we speak)

ce86e81f-22a9-4961-be9a-309a2f0276cb,"Academics - 5/5. All of my professors were extremely knowledgeable, helpful, and flexible. Having smaller class sizes was great for me and it allowed my professors to get to know me. All of my professors know my name which is rewarding. 

Facilities/Campus - 5/5. Buildings are very clean and almost never busy. Everything is brick and looks extremely put together, I also love the lake, gazebo, and amphitheater. 

Diversity - 2.5/5. Although there are a decent amount of non-white students, campus remains very segregated racially. If you are involved in Greek life, you will rarely see non-white students. If you are not, you will rarely see white students. 


Other things: School spirit lacking, food overrated (you get tired after a while, not many vegan/vegetarian options), very safe (ignore the safety rating; can leave your things in a random building for hours), dorms are pretty big, campus tucked away so not much within walking distance, VERY cliquey (like high school because small)",4,Freshman,2023-05-01 01:14:55,Overall Experience,94a3b32f-7213-4ea2-bc3a-5aa612b3850c,2023,University of Richmond,positive

It is located around 20 minutes away from the city of Richmond, so you'll be able to find a lot of good food and things to do in the city during free time at school. However, the University of Richmond, while trying it's best, remains a school with not too much diversity on campus, and definitely culturally there isn't too much interaction between people of diverse backgrounds. Campus food often closes too early, making finding food after a certain time difficult and it becomes difficult to find study spaces before finals.

The resources on campus are also endless. There is a highly vocalized opportunity to engage in research alongside professors, and career services that help launch well prepared students into internships.

From a social aspect, there is still a lot of work to be done for students of color and overall equity at the school. There is a clear gap and bias present on campus and inside the classrooms.

One aspect that  disappointed me was how dominating greek life is on campus and the VAST majority of frat bros/girls are rich white people who are very cliquey.

This school does not value diversity or care about hate crimes, student safety, students’ futures; completely falsifying its values. Living on a campus where you receive an alert every week for either a robbery, stabbing, shooting, harassment, etc is sad. 1000 Characters is not enough to explain the hatred and racism on this campus either. From a fraternity having a noose hanging in their house, to hate speech on the sidewalks, and even a White-Supremacist stabbing a Black student to death in the act of hate crime. During the school year students demanded change on this campus and constantly we were denied. Denied safety, diversity, a voice.

High COL area, low stipend makes getting by extremely difficult if not impossible for the average grad student. Parking is expensive for all, and it's no better for grad students. Mandatory fees close to 700, meanwhile the university doubled it's endowment to $3B during COVID. Bottom line: we're employees and students when it's convenient for them, not for us.  I find the area to be unfriendly to grad students in that there's not much for us to do.

Student organizations, events, and proximity to D.C. expanded horizons. Diversity conversations were present, yet sometimes lacked actionable results. A shortage of diverse faculty occasionally hindered finding mentors who understood my specific challenges. Despite these hurdles, my UMD experience remains positive.

Academics: cox is a great business school and they set you up for success in that world. It also helps that Dallas is a growing city. Any other degree program, look somewhere else. The student body is not academically oriented. You will need extreme self-discipline and the capability to walk alone if you want good academic opportunities. Trust me, it is harder than it sounds
Social: The first year and a half will be the most fun of your life. You need a fake ID. Frats primarily rent out bars and clubs for events. Wed-Sat expect at least two options each night. If you are not in greek life you're screwed but even if you are it might not be much better. If you are attractive with a lot of money this school will be great for you. Otherwise there is a lot of focus on social hierarchy. Everybody knows everybody so expect high school pt 2

I was convinced to choose the two hardest majors I could and did really well in them yet still have no knowledge of what I need to know for the future. SMU thrives on dumb people telling smart people what to do to boost their numbers in certain ways. The administration and counseling department have no understanding of the student body and if they really wanted what was right they would simply do a better job of encouraging the students. Instead they seem to have no other role other than to diagnose students with disorders that give them drugs that ""dim them out"" or to try and send good people away due to their negligence. SMU has great potential especially being in the heart of a great city like Dallas., but fails when it comes down to the administrative positions.

I came to this campus expecting to meet people and have new experience, but students on this campus stick to their own kind. There is the group that enjoys the privilege that their ethnicity and economic and social status bring them, and they are reluctant to see the world outside of their own bubble. And SMU is their bubble. I regret coming to this school, and I could have gone to other universities that has more diversity.

The scholarships/grants that the school gives out is not enough to get by without loans. I couldn't think of one year when I didn't borrow money. Another issue that I had with SMU was the constant construction. I have against nothing against new construction but I noticed that the existing dorms that needed remodeling were hardly touched.

GW is not a school but instead an corporation that cares very little for their students. The school is insanely expensive and provided with me a sub par education; while yes I was there for only one semester, I was rarely challenged or interested in my classes. disregarding one class, my classes were all 70-300 people and individualized attention was impossible. I should have expected this with a large school but the show the school puts on for interested students manipulated the reality of what class size would be like. Beyond academics and price, I never once felt at home at gw. The school has little to no school spirit and most of the time I felt like I was just living in a big city not a college campus. I never thought that community would be such a big part of being happy at a college but after going to GW where there absolutely no community, I realized it is essential. While I met a few wonderful people, on the whole the kids at GW are rich kids who only care about what opportunity they can seize next and do not care much about anyone but themselves. The school is primarily liberal so I was expecting to find like minded people to me but instead found some of the most close minded people I have ever met who care more about the idea of politics than the actual issues. The best way to describe them is people that recycle because everyone else is recycling, not because it's the right thing to do. In reality, this negative review is influenced by the fact that GW wasn't right for me. there are kids that love GW, but for me, the school lacked a reason for its price, a friendly welcoming community, people who genuinely care about each other, a administration that isn't shady and frustrating, and mainly, that feeling of home that so many kids feel when they're at college.",1,Freshman,2016-01-03 01:33:02,Overall Experience,e3dffeaa-58fa-41d3-bf56-fe2ea314642c,2016,George Washington University,negative

They got rid of the 4+1 program for some degrees which was one of the reasons why I went there. 

There is absolutely no community at this school. The only bond that students had was about how much they disliked the school. They changed the dining plan which was a HUGE mistake.

The faculty members at OSU are not only experts in their respective fields but also passionate educators who genuinely care about their students.

The beauty of Stillwater, Oklahoma, with its rolling plains and welcoming small-town atmosphere, provided the ideal backdrop for my college experience.

It is definitely a school where you can make tons of new acquaintances and even form long term friendships. When it comes to the academics at Rutgers, most classes can be very demanding but not impossible. What I find helps most are the study groups that students can join when they are having difficulty with a class. They even have tutors you can request online for those that prefer one on one. The only thing is that students have to put in their own hard work and effort because professors will not be pushing individual students when they have over 100 students in a class or maybe even more.",5,Sophomore,2023-08-09 23:04:16,Overall Experience,c494ce31-603e-46e3-a477-a03dae81c1be,2023,Rutgers University–New Brunswick,negative

CC prides itself on freedom of thought, but actively seeks to exert as much control as possible over their students to the detriment of those students’ housing, nutrition, and creative pursuits. CC’s campus safety policing decisions show that they are far more interested in exerting this control whenever possible than actually keeping students safe. I for one would never call them for help and know I am far from alone. After one anti-racism review, CC is already patting itself on the back for a COMPLETED job well done.

- The workload is very intense. My day is completely focused on work with few breaks.
- It seems like everyone settles into friend groups around the first month or so. Make friends early.
- I've been harassed and catcalled by multiple people. My RA said that the problem is ""completely out of control"" and that all her friends on-campus had this happen to them too. The Title IX office is small and can't do anything about it, and I don't feel safe outside.
- There's a really strong ""nerd culture"" on campus, which could be great if you're into that. However, if you aren't (like me), the atmosphere feels extremely isolating.

Being around people who love school the way I do and are passionate about engineering like me has taught me so much. I thrive in an environment where I am surrounded by hard-working people who love to learn. My freshman year was tough don't get me wrong, but it is all about trial and error. You have to be able to understand what works for you, and sometimes the only way you can learn that is by falling down in life and having to get back up.

They are wanna-be greats but have no clue about the reality of the lameness of their chapter relative to what's out there. Most saddening is the way that the school does almost nothing to help you out. My initial estimate for financial aid was $25k. Now, as a senior, I receive HOPE scholarship (about 4K) and that is it. If it weren't too late in the game, I would have transferred out as soon as they cut my financial aid.

The great parts about the school are that it has a lot of diversity which creates an awesome learning environment, and Atlanta is a cool city to live in. However, Emory is not actually in Atlanta proper which is a huge let down because you have to take a ~20 minute uber to get anywhere cool. The dorms are big for freshman, but you are not guaranteed housing all four years and sophomore housing is much worse. The campus is beautiful except that for all of my freshman year it was under construction. The party scene revolves around greek life or going to Mags, so if you're not into that you don't have many other options until you have your own home to host things at.

There is no school spirit on this campus. Initially, I thought this wouldn't be an issue because I wasn't looking for a party school, and I really have no interest in going out to parties. However, without a sports team, and a central hangout spot on campus, there is no sense of unity between the students. Any sort of social life is centered around Greek life because that's the only thing there is.

The food on campus is absolutely terrible. Have you heard about the health inspections done on the dining halls and cafes on campus? Yeah, they failed health inspections. Also, the chicken is always severely undercooked; its always pink.

For the most part the teachers are not as thorough in teaching material as on main campus, there is zero social life (you are in a low income neighborhood in the middle of nowhere Georgia), and teachers assign absurd amounts of busy work (I had less work in 400 level courses at Emory than here). In addition the classes are significantly harder for no reason. I signed up for calc 1 at oxford and had to drop it, luckily still during add/drop period. When I proceeded to the main campus I signed up for cal 1 again and received an A in the course. I then took calc 2 the following semester and received an A. Oxford is significantly harder and your GPA will be lower than the main campus students, which can hurt after college job options.

As an econ major at Emory there are a couple amazing teachers but for the most part the teachers are sub-par, whether it be due to poor teaching style or just clearly not caring caring about students (I had a teacher who refused to meet with students who couldnt come to her office hours because they were in class during them). 

Social experience is repetitive, all about Greek life (I was in Greek life too and I got tired of it). Feels like 70% of people you meet are from long island.

There is little to no sense of community unless you join Greek life which in and of itself can be pretty exclusionary subsequently transfer rates are high.There is virtually no effort made in creating opportunities for freshman to meet one another and consequently people stick to who they know setting the tone for the rest of their time here.

Analyzing works in a different language has helped me better understand research papers to improve designing experiments. Learning about the technical nuances of coding has brought insight into the importance of paying attention to grammar and spelling in a different language, rather than simply focusing on the big picture. Additionally, Emory's small student-to-faculty ratio has given me greater  access to professors, who can better assess my work and provide critical feedback.

The diversity, specifically in regards to the number of black students, needs to be addressed. Emory has increased the number they've accepted in recent years, but it remains relatively low when examining the acceptance numbers of other racial groups. Additionally, I would consider the academic atmosphere of Emory to be divisive at times. There is a culture that you must always be studying and busy in order to achieve.

One example is the area near where there used to be a student living apartment across from McDonalds. That part could use a remodel. There are also many spots on campus where the concrete walls and the floors have orange rust looking stains, there are cracks on the floor and stairs, there are lots of marks, etc. One example are near the stairs next to Suwanee (both sides) close to the dumpsters, or any other part where there are dumpsters nearby. Aesthetics are something I care about, but there are more important issues that need more attention. FSU has a mold problem in some parts. The windows of the Strozier library, some floors and walls, and even some buildings have mold. There is one on-campus building and student living apartment that had to be shut down due to mold.

One, the College of Business cannot host the amount of students it accepts so get ready for your first two years of college to be almost entirely online if you’re looking to be a business major. Also look into your course requirements for yourself because the only time I used COB Advising, they recommended a class I didn’t need. Second, most majors have deadlines after which you cannot enter the program if you do not have all of your prerequisites done by that time. This is probably my biggest complaint about the university. It’s one thing to fine for excess credits taken (which they also do), it’s another to make people choose a career they don’t like because they figured out they wanted to do Computer Science 1  1/2 years in.

Now in fall, I would say is a much more unique experience than summer because there are many more people here and it can be very crowded and chaotic. It is still fun but not like summer at all. The teachers are stricter, classes are harder because during fall you are required to take more, and so the work can pile up.

The are of improvement needed is the parking. It is difficult to find a parking space and the rules are not very clear. I received a couple tickets just because I did not know. But I quickly learned.

A Machine Learning course exactly like this is offered every term at my current state school, and is even a requirement for the CS major.

In a small school its easier to stand out, get a better education, and explore more career opportunities since there isn't any competition for valuable positions (i.e., most students are in multiple clubs)
Party Scene: There are parties every weekend, but quality varies between years tbh. All the parties are held in the on-campus townhouses, so if the students living one year are more ""party-ers"" then there will be more parties that year. 

Housing: All students live on campus which makes college feel like a home and community. Out of the 30ish options of housing to live in I'd say 10ish choices are ""very good"" - the others are average in facility quality 

Culture: Over the place. Everyone is very nice. People are liberal, but most are center leaning. Very cliquey like a highschool without bullying",4,Junior,2022-11-26 04:40:30,Overall Experience,66d370e2-6bbb-4e64-bff6-d719a0ddb2cb,2022,Carleton College,positive

On a more positive note, you will be hard-pressed to find a school with more spirit and gumption. The magic of a Texas A&M gameday is unmatched, and you can't help but feel a sense of pride and togetherness, which helps to offset the sometimes overwhelming size of the University.

I wouldn't say the classes (from my experience as a pre-dental student) have been overly hard but there are some weeks you're going to have to put your head down and work. Football games are always so much fun, we have the loudest stadium in the nation and you just really feel at home and like a part of the community on game days. Also there's a stereotype about A&M being country, which can be true but as the least country dude arounds, its not overwhelming.",4,Senior,2023-10-25 17:23:10,Overall Experience,ac9cfdaf-b7c0-44c8-931b-af5caa160f52,2023,Texas A&M University,positive

The dorms are nice for what you are paying, but there are a ton of people on campus.  It can feel like more of a city than a school, especially if you do not come from a very high populated town.

There's dozens of fast food restaurants, mini stores, and even a bus system on campus, making it easier to live here if living off campus makes you nervous. What makes this a four star rating instead of five is the costs and how crowded it is. Learning at A&M is expensive without ample amounts of financial aid, and we get thousands of new students each year, so it feels like walking around in New York sometimes. And Game Day can become extremely chaotic, but only because the games are worth watching.
