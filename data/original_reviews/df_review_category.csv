There are a couple underground frats which still live together and throw parties, and their membership is generally known to most students, but they have no official events or organization. It's unclear how long they will last with this status. There are no sororities. Recently, a pilot program of five social clubs have been founded. These are basically co-ed fraternities that are directly controlled/funded by the college. The aim of these is to provide more social options for Amherst students and encourage students to meet people outside of particular interest/activity groups (BSU, GAP, orchestra, sports teams) while not letting them develop the apparent exclusivity of the former fraternities. Time will tell if these clubs improve social life at Amherst or just further increase the way that students here tend to categorize themselves and ignore potential relationships outside their existing groups.",negative,Sophomore,2016-03-11 11:08:08,social_life,127ec524-4bac-4a5c-a7f5-1ead9c309f44,2016,Amherst College

The trustees' resolution banning fraternities combined with the scheduled demolition of the social dormitories guarantees there will be no party scene at Amherst within the next few years. I am thoroughly perplexed by the administration's decisions: the Amherst social scene has been on a steady decline for the last decade, and they have done nothing to fix it other than to build the mediocre Powerhouse, which has had no real effect other than limiting the party scene to 2am. Furthermore, Saturday night is really the only night worth going out on, and even then, there are some Saturdays where there is literally nothing going on. I actually pity future Amherst classes that will have absolutely no options for partying. Parties are an integral part of college life and provide an important outlet for stress; if the administration does not figure something out in the coming years, parties will cease to exist.

The furthest dorms from campus are still only about a 10 minute walk through a safe area. Furthermore, dorm RCs are, at least in my experience, helpful when you need them, but not too nosy or heavy handed. Generally, if you don't regularly make a mess, cause dorm damage, or disturb your hall mates, they will give you a pass on most things. Room draw can be a stressful process, especially if you have a big group, but the college seems to be doing all it can to streamline it and make it as fair as possible. I do think that many of the dorms are lacking in amenities, especially upperclassmen dorms. It seems a little basic to put things like water fountains and vending machines in all dorms. Some of the common rooms are also under furnished and not containing many incentives for students to gather there. Something like a ping pong table or foosball would definitely turn many common rooms into more of a social space rather than a place for one or two people to quietly study. Also, several dorms don't have elevators, so if you suffer an injury during the school year, good luck? Finally, the social atmosphere in dorms can be very hit or miss. Some freshman dorms (particularly when the whole building is sub-free) form close bonds and stay friends throughout their time at Amherst.

Greek life adds very little to Cornell. The philanthropy they carry out is often for publicity stunts, and they do very little philanthropy and volunteering. The students very rarely care much about academics and are only concerned about sliding by classes with good grades and getting good jobs. Greek life is cultish and cliquey, and I find that if you're not part of Greek life, you may be able to get into parties, but you'll generally be excluded from the Greek community as a whole. And even the social scene they offer is very limited and almost always revolves around alcohol. I'm sorry, but wine tours? How is that fun!?! Because you go and get blasted out of your minds! Although Greek life states that it exists for academics, philanthropy, and fraternity, I, as stated above, find that it's the complete opposite.

The worst part about the issue with Greek life is that it seems that the administration ignores the woes of Greek life because students in Greek life will end up being the most generous donors to Cornell after they graduate. Yes, I've said it: The reason why I think the administration is often lenient (note: NOT always lenient, especially with regard to hazing, thank the Lord) toward Greek life is because Greek life becomes a symbol of fraternity to Cornell students, which increases the likelihood that they'll enjoy their experience at Cornell and want to give back. So I think that the administration actually discriminates toward Greek organizations.

Additionally, what Greek life does do can be accomplished with through on-campus housing. Philanthropy? Look into the PSC (doubt many Greek life even know what it is). Fraternity? West Campus, although it may not be the best fit for many students, is plenty fraternal. Academics? Honors and preprofessional fraternities.

12a8b1a9-545c-4fa6-bfaf-f7358e4e3e6b,"Overall Pathetic. All Parties End at Snack Bar – Nightlife at Williams is generally limited to on-campus parties because Williamstown is small and quiet. It's also high up in the mountains in the middle of nowhere. By pure observation, I would say that students spend at least an hour pre-gaming, another half an hour looking for a party to go to, and the next few hours dancing (or not dancing...) at various locations around campus. 

There's also First Fridays, a dance that's held on the first Friday of every month. Mostly a freshman hangout spot, and the music gets old after a few times.

For those not into parties, there are alternative activities, but they are severely limited/not very well attended. Have no fear, however, because you'll find friends who like to have quieter weekends- you just have to look for them.

All parties/events ultimately end at snack bar, the late-night service in Paresky Student Center that serves gelatto, smoothies, sandwiches/burgers, salads, tea/coffee, etc. until 1am. The fact that it closes at 1am also means that most parties are finished by 1am, which is both a blessing and a curse, depending on how you want to look at it.",negative,Sophomore,2012-06-03 01:15:53,social_life,465d4a73-875c-498e-9c8f-e47568e156f2,2012,Williams College

While the administration has designated assault survivor services, which are so, so great, as a whole the administration seems to try to bury reports of assault.

If you enjoy parties: Frats happen (most) every weekend but are by no means reliably good. Alcohol is the most prevalent drug, but marijuana comes in as a very very close second. Frat parties have ""themes"" like space race, or 80s, or something, and people drink beforehand rather than actually at the frat (not always the case) and then there's a lot of loud music, lights, and grinding. Most people get really drunk as soon as they get a moment to decompress then wind up at frat parties and have a pretty okay time. Big parties like Endless KA or Snowchella or some of the other major all-campuses the frats throw are usually the funnest, everyone seems to enjoy the larger, more publicized frat parties. A lot of people here don't *really* enjoy frat (or frat-style, because row parties at Synergy or French House or whatever are just frat parties without greek letters) parties because they're massive, impersonal, and you have to be a certain level of drunk to enjoy them, but they continue to go to frat parties due to a lack of other things to do. Dorms above frosh level often have to fill out ""party request forms"" in order to have get togethers (cough cough crothers) but closer, smaller, parties with drinking and friends are usually better when possible. Girls/guys in sororities/frats report party life as being much better due to the progressives that they have with each other/within greek life. Going off campus for clubs/bars/parties is not really a thing.

If you aren't into parties: Cardinal Nights occasionally rolls out a really fun event but for the most part is, unfortunately, regarded as a joke. Most social life/night life revolves heavily around drinking. You have to be really active in finding outside activities or people who don't drink (they do exist!)

Macalester also has a ""gender house"" in Kirk designed for students wishing to explore issues of gender and sexuality.  It is a joke.  Most of the kids who applied for it the first year were rising sophomores who just wanted an excuse to live in upperclassmen dorms and drink without getting caught by RAs.  Frequently both toilets would have vomit on them so there would be no real way to go to the bathroom until a janitor arrived.  Complaints about this did nothing to help the situation.  It was loud enough to be a super bowl night at two a.m. on weeknights and was fairly ridiculous.  I have also heard that the Veggie Co-Op is incredibly cliquey and is kind of the closest thing we have to a sorority or a fraternity.  Most people living there aren't actually even vegetarians or vegans, but are simply living there to be closer to friends and not have to be on the meal plan.

e0433a53-cfa2-45bf-8132-9f2255dc9366,"our football and basketball teams are pretty awful. depending on the opponent, I have seen fans of the opposing team nearly outnumber WM students at football games (i.e. the 2012 game versus Delaware). we don't have a varsity men's lacrosse team. a lot of our students don't seem to be huge sports fans in general, and I think that extends to caring about collegiate sports. I am a woman who is a huge NFL and NHL fan, and I have many friends who couldn't name 3 players on the Redskins, who are probably the most popular NFL team on campus. we definitely have school pride in spades, but lackluster major sports programs (due in large part to difficulty recruiting talent to a school like this) and general student apathy towards pro and college sports in general makes for a school that you shouldn't attend if you want college football or basketball to be a big part of your life. I think at larger schools a star football player would be a bit of a campus celebrity; that is not the case here at all. Go to Tech, UVA, JMU, or even VCU if you want an in-state school w decent sports.

They have something that they call a ""gap"" which basically means that they acknowledge up to a certain amount of aid that they simply will not match. After that, they'll only meet a certain percent of your demonstrated need. On top of that, they do not give out-of-state students work/study, and they have VERY few merit scholarships for out-of-state students. They have some scholarships that look like merit scholarships, but the money you receive goes toward any research you might conduct, not toward your tuition. I am an excellent student, one of the top in my class, I've made Dean's List every semester, and I have yet to be given a merit scholarship. On top of that, if you're having trouble, they won't do anything to help you, and they very obviously favor in-state-students. Out-of-state students were called ""bags of gold with feet"" by the college president earlier this year, which just goes to show you how little they actually care about us as people.

Still with this caveat I am able to participate in Greek activities. As a rising Sophomore guy, I have lived through the worst of the social scene and remained relatively unscathed. If you put yourself out there and meet the dudes and girls in the Greek system you will at least be on their radar. One of the nice things about Colgate is that even with its limited houses, they're all pretty much on the same tier just different kinds of guys. Stereotypes in fraternities are extremely real and accurate. If you are disgusted with the Greek system or the heteronormative/homophobic/sexist/racist social structure then Colgate will be hard for you. Greek life is just so ingrained in Colgate culture, that it is hard to have one night where there is nothing going on whether it is just the guys inviting down freshmen to get to know them or a large party/darty on a random night of the week. It is hard to be outside of the social norm and get in with the fraternities. You must fit the preppy, laidback bro in order to be considered a real contender for most of the house at Colgate, however, there are a few ""nice guy"" fraternities currently.

As a girl, I chose not to join because (a) it wasn't my thing, (b) I knew a bunch of upperclassmen girls who I respected and admired who weren't in it and who assured me my social life wouldn't suffer without it. 

I'm really happy with my choice not to join, but I do have friends in a couple of the sororities, and it has had zero effect on our friendships. And, as a girl, I can still get into the majority of frat parties without a problem, so my social life hasn't suffered. As part of a sorority, you'll have more connections and more opportunities to mix with frat guys, but I had no problem going to just a party or two each weekend.  

As a guy, it's harder because if you don't join a fraternity, you won't be able to get into any frat parties (except in special circumstances) and sororities don't have parties. So joining greek life is a bigger deal for guys. 

That said, there are plenty of other opportunities to socialize and party/ Club sports such as water polo, skiing, and rugby have plenty of ""pubs"" among themselves, and other organizations such as a capella groups and OE and geology club party a lot too. Even physics club has an annual formal. Then there's always the jug or other bars in town. Or just hang with your friends.

Also, parking is limited to those who can afford it; many resident students park in the ""off campus"" parking lot because $400 for different inconvenient spot does not seem worth it to them, and the closer you want to park to the colleges (dorms) the more the price increases on those spots.

All of those things have happened to people I know. Apparently Brown forgot to fill out a key question on US News college survey, resulting in very low rankings this year from that missed question. It doesn't surprise me that Brown would forget something like that, even though it's important to outside people. 

Most of the administration would have been great if Brown were the hippie-liberal-brainwashed school it was 15 years ago, but the students are now smart and sophisticated- which means that there's a lot of tension/hatred for deans and administrators.

Heater provided, AC provided, a maid that comes and clean the lounges and bathrooms on a biweekly basis... but it all really depends on what dorm you end up in. Most of the dorms have people or legacies of being disgusting. 

The most troublesome dorms are West, North, and Linde. They have broken glass in the courtyards. The smell of weed is always present in the dorm. There are bottles of alcohol left in the lounge and when people get drunk, they spill alcohol all over the floor. They play beer pong and they leave the cups out there for days, for the cleaning people to clean up. 

Sontag, North, and East are dorms that are very exclusive and unless you are a part of the culture there, you should never go there or you will be ostracized. In short, the social atmosphere at Mudd is stifling.

The cost is ridiculous. It costs over $1000 to live on campus PER MONTH. That goes for if you are in a single, a double, a triple, OR EVEN A QUAD (where there are four people to a room that is the size of 2 doubles). You will never be allowed to live off campus because they are building a new dorm, so it is guaranteed that the school will do everything they can to force you to live on campus so that they can make the most money they can.

Convenience is horrible, there are no places to eat out that are less than a mile's walk away, and you get tired of the meal plan quick. It is extremely hard to get off the meal plan at Mudd.

The worst thing about Campus Housing at Mudd is how you get your room. There is this thing called Room Draw that breaks up friendships, causes betrayals, and forces the quietest, most innocent students to live in dorms where people smoke weed and other serious substances right outside their room doors, where drunk people pee in the bushes right outside their doors, and where they have to leave their dorms because there is rock music blasting right next to their rooms at 1am on a Tuesday night.",negative,Junior,2015-03-23 17:45:41,campus_facilities,20d662be-8428-4de2-bf0d-72d22f0a04b5,2015,Harvey Mudd College

Generally speaking, if you do not seek out their help, they will not be of any assistance to you. And the school does not host a lot of top companies. The only industries that it is decent at are health care and consulting. Health care is a major industry in Nashville because of the tax incentives offered by the state of Tennessee to health care companies. Consulting is decent because a number of Vanderbilt alumni have gone on to work for major consulting firms. But in reality, none of the classes at Vanderbilt are really that useful for going into consulting. Thus, you're going to have to sell yourself to the consulting firms as a well-rounded generalist.",negative,Alum,2016-02-20 13:22:33,affordability,8a41db38-a2bb-4999-991b-cb37387781d7,2016,Vanderbilt University

ba228c6c-7f44-455b-bb08-25955d9153da,"Commons is great; new buildings and great social atmosphere that fosters friendships. Apart from Commons, everywhere else is generally dead. Nobody likes to venture out of their rooms to meet or hang out with others who live in the same building. McGill is the exception to this, but in terms of building quality and cleanliness, every single residence hall needs to be renovated. There's mold and a musty smell in at least one corner of each building. I have yet to find a building other than Kissam or Commons where students do not need dehumidifiers. In my res hall, there's no thermostat, so you're stuck between frigid AC when the temp is >55 degrees and sweltering heaters when <55 degrees, both on full blast. 

The dorms also need more and better social spaces. Almost every floor in every hall is nothing but corridors, which leaves no space for socializing or studying with others on the same floor. Recreation rooms in the residence hall have very few amenities (e.g. Tolman has only a foosball table in its basement). Study spaces are almost non-existent.

The only downside to Commons is its distance from main campus. As for upperclass housing, Morgan/Lewis seem to be the best in terms of cleanliness and space. The major downside to the ""nice"" housing, however, is the distance from everything except the gym and Blair.

Since that point he has made it his personal priority to bust all drug dealers on campus, with the thought that if they are gone then nobody will smoke cannabis.
