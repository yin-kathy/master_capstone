Within the first few days of moving in, I was met by many welcoming freshmen, who just like me, were interested in meeting new people outside of their once smaller circles. As I was in a LLC program, there were numerous events such as scavenger hunts, arts and crafts, and group ice breakers that allowed me to feel more involved within the student body of UIUC. As for academics, the level of work and challenge of each class is very dependent on your major and the amount of credit hours one decides to take. U of I freshmen meet with their advisors during orientation to decide on how to shape their first semester, but I recommend researching course workload and professors beforehand as that information isnâ€™t provided in the sessions. One of the highlights of UIUC for me would definitely be the college campus. As it is a campus town, the environment is designed specially with the habits and needs of students in mind."

c4f89ae1-232d-4289-ac65-ac58c9e2f899,"I think the career services can do a better job. In general, it is very hard to network with past alumni. The career center has very few job postings and that most are only open to US-residents. I would be great to see the career center bolster our alumni network and reach out to more companies to provide opportunities."
f4107b01-8e84-4d17-ad86-63be49f0dce4,"Terrible, small snobby, school. Faculty is not as supportive and nurturing as they want you to believe. If you're a minority or nontraditional student don't expect support. They're just checking boxes by accepting you. Once you get there you're on your own to sink or swim. They work hard to make it seem like a paradise though. They try to minimize bad press so they can get good applications. Too small for it's own good. It's like living in a fish bowl. Very cliquish. If you weren't one of the popular ones in high school navigating this social minefield will be the biggest challenge of your life. Everyone thinks they're gods gift to humanity. Academics are okay but nothing special. Education ultimately is what you make of it. You might think you're awesome for going here but in real life no one knows wtf Amherst is and no one cares. Visit, ask questions, do your research and try not to be taken in by the rankings alone. I had a good life before I ever knew the name Amherst."
c8b142ed-2c3e-452c-8ec8-299bd2a8c841,"My time at Tulane University will be remembered as some of the best years of my life. I feel that since going there I have become smarter, more confident and just overall have grown a lot as a person. The one thing I wish that was stronger is the career services available to students in terms of getting internships and jobs. I know Tulane has a strong alumni network and I think it could be utilized better. Aside from that, I could not have asked for a better college experience. The people I met and culture I was able to immerse myself in was unlike any other. New Orleans is such a special city and I would strongly recommend that anyone who has the chance to live there, takes it. I will miss everything about my time at Tulane and am definitely envious of students who are just about to start their time there."

However, if you're not financially well off you will have to work multiple jobs and hustle to afford housing, food and basic necessities. New York is very expensive. If you don't receive enough financial aid help, the tuition will be a large burden as well. So for students who come from a humble background, adjusting and thriving to this lifestyle may come at the expense of mental sanity. Having to work full time and attend school full time is as strenuous as it gets."
278c103f-8c1b-412b-aa21-f7a3a837cbfe,"Financial aid promised a specific amount when I first applied for the school, that amount then changed (decreased) when I accepted their offer, then changed once more (decreased again) promptly before the first few weeks of school. I understood that all of the numbers before the amount was actually due were just ""estimates"" but I found it quite obnoxious that the amount I owed the school more than quadrupled from the time that I applied to the time that I entered. Even after contacting the school and informing them of my hardship to pay the amount asked for, nothing changed and ZERO efforts were made to help accommodate my financial NEED, something that factored in very much so in my initial acceptance of their offer."
fe21b345-544d-41a8-8d9a-72bd94ec8771,I've loved my time at WashU. The campus is gorgeous and they have great academic resources and amenities. The one thing I would like to see change is more one-on-one attention with academic advisors. The food could also be better.
4e221aea-5bec-4b22-b5d0-308c03eb690b,"Babson is truly great for Business, particularly for finance, investment banking, and entrepreneurship. The beautiful parts of campus are definitely the physical attributes of the campus itself, the diverse population here, and the home-like feeling at all times. While there are some aspects that aren't the best such as the social life or the food, it definitely doesn't take away from my experience. Everything comes together once you start life at Babson and I am extremely happy with my accomplishments here along with the resources Babson has provided me to do such."

0082106e-a6eb-452d-bb06-afec37273a30,"CC is extremely homogeneous. The visible majority of the student body are white, upper class, heterosexual, and democrats. However, people tend to be accepting of differing race, economic background, religion, sexual orientation, etc. Students and professors alike claim to be open-minded, but conservatives are received poorly. People stick to what they know, i.e. international students tend to hang out together. It takes effort to break the bubble within the CC bubble."
