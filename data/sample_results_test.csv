As for my experience in the School of Liberal Arts, my teachers have been wonderful. I've only had a great experience during my time at Tulane.","['academics', 'campus']"
c8b142ed-2c3e-452c-8ec8-299bd2a8c841,"My time at Tulane University will be remembered as some of the best years of my life. I feel that since going there I have become smarter, more confident and just overall have grown a lot as a person. The one thing I wish that was stronger is the career services available to students in terms of getting internships and jobs. I know Tulane has a strong alumni network and I think it could be utilized better. Aside from that, I could not have asked for a better college experience. The people I met and culture I was able to immerse myself in was unlike any other. New Orleans is such a special city and I would strongly recommend that anyone who has the chance to live there, takes it. I will miss everything about my time at Tulane and am definitely envious of students who are just about to start their time there.","['career_prep', 'alumni_network', 'community', 'location']"

The beautiful parts of campus are definitely the physical attributes of the campus itself, the diverse population here, and the home-like feeling at all times. While there are some aspects that aren't the best such as the social life or the food, it definitely doesn't take away from my experience. Everything comes together once you start life at Babson and I am extremely happy with my accomplishments here along with the resources Babson has provided me to do such.","['academics', 'diversity', 'campus']"

278c103f-8c1b-412b-aa21-f7a3a837cbfe,"Financial aid promised a specific amount when I first applied for the school, that amount then changed (decreased) when I accepted their offer, then changed once more (decreased again) promptly before the first few weeks of school. I understood that all of the numbers before the amount was actually due were just ""estimates"" but I found it quite obnoxious that the amount I owed the school more than quadrupled from the time that I applied to the time that I entered. Even after contacting the school and informing them of my hardship to pay the amount asked for, nothing changed and ZERO efforts were made to help accommodate my financial NEED, something that factored in very much so in my initial acceptance of their offer.","['administration', 'affordability']"
