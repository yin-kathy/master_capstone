Other sources of grant aid are excluded. Aid awarded anytime during the full aid year is included.

Average net price is generated by subtracting the average amount of federal, state or local government, or institutional grant and scholarship aid from the total cost of attendance.  Total cost of attendance is the sum of published tuition and required fees (lower of in-district or in-state), books and supplies and the weighted average room and board and other expenses.

The weighted average for room and board and other expenses is generated as follows:

  (amount for on-campus room, board and other expenses * # of students living on-campus. 
  +  amount for off-campus (with family) room, board and other expenses * # of students living off-campus with family
  +  amount for off-campus (not with family) room, board and other expenses * # of students living off-campus not with family)

divided by the total # of students.

Students whose living arrangements are unknown are excluded from the calculation.  For some institutions the # of students by living arrangement will be known, but dollar amounts will not be known.  In this case the # of students with no corresponding dollar amount will be excluded from the denominator.

Applicable to public institutions with standard calendar systems (semester, quarter, trimester, 4-1-4) that report financial aid data for students enrolled for the FALL and awarded aid anytime during the full aid year.

In-state tuition is the tuition charged by institutions to those students who meet the state's or institution's residency requirements. In-district tuition is the tuition charged by the institution to those students residing in the locality in which they attend school and may be a lower rate than in-state tuition if offered by the institution. </td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td style='font-weight:bold;' colspan=2>Format</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Data type:</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Field width:</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable format:</td><td>Cont</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable number:</td><td>70711</td></tr></table><br /><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td colspan='2'>Source</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Var source:</td><td>IPEDS, Winter 2022-23, Student Financial Aid component</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>File title:</td><td>Average net price for full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students, 2019-20 to 2021-22</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Section title:</td><td>Average net price for full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduate students, 2019-20 to 2021-22</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Table name:</td><td>SFA2122</td></tr></table><br /><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0' style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td>&nbsp;Maximum</td><td>&nbsp;Minimum</td><td>&nbsp;Mean</td><td>&nbsp;Standard deviation</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;45657</td><td>&nbsp;-2095</td><td>&nbsp;10544</td><td>&nbsp;5218.67</td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheaderdark'><td style='text-align:center;' colspan='2'>NPGRN2 - Average net price-students awarded grant or scholarship aid, 2021-22</td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:left;'>Average net price for full-time, first-time degree/certificate-seeking undergraduates who were awarded grant or scholarship aid from federal, state or local governments, or the institution.

Applicable to private not-for-profit and for-profit institutions with standard calendar systems (semester, quarter, trimester, 4-1-4) that report financial aid data for students enrolled for the FALL and awarded aid anytime during the full aid year. These institutions report cost of attendance for the full academic year.

Also, applicable to public or private institutions that measure courses primarily by clock hours, or offers primarily occupational programs measured in credit hours with calendar systems that are continuous, or differs by programs. These institutions report financial aid data for students enrolled between the 12-month period (September 1 through August 31) and awarded aid anytime during the full aid year. These institutions report cost of attendance for their largest program for the length of that program.

For institutions that report cost of attendance for the full academic year an average yearly net price is generated by subtracting the average amount of federal, state or local government, or institutional grant and scholarship aid from the total cost of attendance.  Total cost of attendance is the sum of published tuition and required fees, books and supplies and the weighted average room and board and other expenses.

The weighted average for room and board and other expenses is generated as follows:

  (amount for on-campus room, board and other expenses * # of students living on-campus. 
  +  amount for off-campus (with family) room, board and other expenses * # of students living off-campus with family
  +  amount for off-campus (not with family) room, board and other expenses * # of students living off-campus not with family)

divided by the total # of students.

Students whose living arrangements are unknown are excluded from the calculation.  For some institutions the # of students by living arrangement will be known, but dollar amounts will not be known.  In this case the # of students with no corresponding dollar amount will be excluded from the denominator.

For institutions that report the cost of attendance for their largest program for the length of that program, the cost of attendance is generated as stated above, but is then divided by the number of months to complete the program to produce a monthly cost of attendance. The average amount of federal, state or local government, or institutional grant and scholarship aid is also divided by 12 to produce a monthly average. The average net price is generated by subtracting the average monthly grant and scholarship aid from the average monthly cost of attendance and the difference is multiplied by the number of months to complete the program.
