This rate is calculated as the total number of students completing a bachelor degree or equivalent within 4-years (100% of normal time) divided by the revised bachelor subcohort minus any allowable exclusions. 

The adjusted bachelor subcohort is defined by the variable GRTOTLT when GRTYPE=8 and the total students completing a bachelor's degree or equivalent within 4-years is GRTOTLT when GRTYPE=13(Table gr2022).

BACHELOR'S OR EQUIVALENT DEGREE-SEEKING SUBCOHORT - In the GRS component of IPEDS, a cohort of students who were seeking a bachelor's or equivalent degree upon entry. 

Normal time to completion -  The amount of time necessary for a student to complete all requirements for a degree or certificate according to the institution's catalog. This is typically 4 years (8 semesters or trimesters, or 12 quarters, excluding summer terms) for a bachelor's degree in a standard term-based institution 
Allowable exclusions - Those students who may be removed (deleted) from the GRS cohort according to the Student Right-to-Know legislation. These include students who died or were totally and permanently disabled; those who left school to serve in the armed forces; those who left to serve with a foreign aid service of the federal government, such as the Peace Corps; and those who left to serve on official church mission. </td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td style='font-weight:bold;' colspan=2>Format</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Data type:</td><td>N</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Field width:</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable format:</td><td>Cont</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Variable number:</td><td>81027</td></tr></table><br /><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td colspan='2'>Source</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Var source:</td><td>Derived DFR - IPEDS, Winter 2022-23, Graduation Rates component</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>File title:</td><td>Frequently used graduation rates</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Section title:</td><td>Frequently used graduation rates</td></tr><tr><td style='font-weight:bold;'>Table name:</td><td>DRVGR2022</td></tr></table><br /><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0' style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheader'><td>&nbsp;Maximum</td><td>&nbsp;Minimum</td><td>&nbsp;Mean</td><td>&nbsp;Standard deviation</td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;100</td><td>&nbsp;0</td><td>&nbsp;39</td><td>&nbsp;24.03</td></tr></table><table border='0' cellpadding='2' cellspacing='0'  style='width:760px;'><tr class='idc_gridviewheaderdark'><td style='text-align:center;' colspan='2'>GBA5RTT - Graduation rate - Bachelor degree within 5 years, total </td></tr><tr><td style='text-align:left;'>5-year graduation rate of the subcohort of full-time, first-time students seeking a bachelor's or equivalent degree  - 2016 Bachelors subcohort (4-year institutions)
